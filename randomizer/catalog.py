# Cross-world placement used to be *derived* rather than declared:
#

#
# with PRS_LOCKED_ENEMIES emptied out. Subtracting an empty set admitted all
# 21 walking-melee types into every world, so an enemy whose mesh/textures had
# never been ported into the host world was still considered "safe" and got
# placed. That is exactly how unported enemies ended up in maps. An explicit,
# per-(enemy, source, target) allowlist replaces the derivation: an enemy may
# only cross into a world that someone actually verified.
#
# STATUS LIFECYCLE
# ----------------
#   CANDIDATE -> the port was verified byte-exact in memory (mesh + textures
#                land where expected), but nobody has seen it render in game
#                yet. CANDIDATE entries ARE active during a run, and every run
#                logs them as unconfirmed so the tester knows what to look at.
#   CONFIRMED -> promoted only after the user watched the enemy render
#                correctly in game. In-memory verification alone never
#                promotes an entry. NO ENTRY IS CONFIRMED TODAY: the two that
#                were have been demoted, because their promotion rested on a
#                byte-exact splice over a false field identification and both
#                render with the wrong model in game.

# *** ALL THREE ROUTES REMAIN CANDIDATE. THE MECHANISM IS NOW CORRECTED. ***
#
# THE CORRECTED MECHANISM
#   A BEF blob's material section at [blob+0x20, blob+0x24) is framed
#   [record_count u32] then per record [len u32][body], and each body opens with
#   one or two 5-byte resource refs [rec_type u8][u32 = flag<<24 | index]:
#   index = bits 0-23, category = bits 24-30, is_global = bit 31. rec_type 0x05
#   carries CATEGORY 1 = a positional index into that world's .PRS MESH TABLE;
#   rec_type 0x04 carries CATEGORY 2 = an index into that world's .PRS ANIM
#   TABLE. The walk parses all 359 blobs of all five worlds exactly, and
#   max_local_cat1 == mesh_count-1 in every world (GRAVE 38/39, CASTLE 58/59,
#   SWAMP 41/42, ICE 40/41, UNDER 39/40). Proof: Dark_Knight 0x53's CASTLE cat-1
#   refs are 25, 25, 26, and CASTLE.PRS mesh[25] is the tag-6, 132,900-byte,
#   34-bone, 31-render-pass PSkeleton with textures exactly {33, 34}.
#   The u16 at blob offset 22 is NOT a mesh index and is no longer read.
#
# WHY NOTHING IS CONFIRMED
#   Every status below stays CANDIDATE. The previous promotions rested on
#   byte-exactness over a false field identification, and both enemies rendered
#   with the wrong model in game. Only the user seeing an enemy render correctly
#   promotes a route. Ports through the corrected path are also gated hard: only
#   GRAVE and ICE pass the target-table gate today, so castle/swamp/under can be
#   sources but not targets.
# ``cross_world.MESH_PORT_ENABLED`` is False, so every route below is refused
# before any mesh extraction and nothing is ever ported. The entries are kept
# deliberately, not deleted, so the routes and their measurements stay on
# HISTORICAL NOTE, kept because it cost a lot to learn
#   Dark_Knight 0x53 and Zombie_Crocodile 0x0D were once CONFIRMED. That rested
#   on a byte-exact splice performed with indices read from a BEF blob's u16@22,
#   which is NOT a mesh-table index (seven native GRAVE.BEF enemies all carry 25
#   there, and Basic_Skeleton 0x47 / Guard_Skeleton 0x54 render correctly in
#   vanilla while looking nothing alike). Both spawned in game with the WRONG
#   MODEL and were demoted. Byte-exactness proves the splice, never the premise.
#   Bomb_Skeleton 0x49's old "mesh[30]" was the same mistake: mesh[30] was never
#   its model, which is why that route froze GRAVE on load.

    # --- ROUTES 4-7: MEASURED. HELD BACK THEN, ACTIVE NOW -------------------
    #
    # READ THE BLOCK BELOW AS HISTORY, NOT AS CURRENT STATE. Three of the four
    # routes under this header -- 0x16 Axe_Guard, 0x27 Hammer_Devil and 0x5D
    # Doomed_Soul -- are ACTIVE (active=True) today. 0x08 Plant_Monster is the
    # only one still held back, and its own entry states why (it is MEASURED TO
    # REFUSE as a group on the same prs_mesh_parser resync gap as 0x53
    # Dark_Knight, and one deliberate known refusal in a draw is enough).
    #
    # WHY THEY WERE OFF, AND WHY THAT REASON EXPIRED
    #   They were held back when `active` was the ONLY size control: every
    #   active route shipped in every build, so activating a measured route GREW
    #   the build, and the build's total is what the RESOURCE pool bounds. With
    #   all seven active the user built an ISO and the game CRASHED ON GRAVE
    #   LEVEL LOAD, so routes were parked one at a time to bisect the ceiling.
    #
    #   `randomizer/roster_selection.py` removed that coupling. The draw is a
    #   seed-chosen SUBSET of the allowlist, and admission bounds the LIVE
    #   resident total (`len(session.prs) + len(session.prt)`) against
    #   `pool_budget` after every commit. So the allowlist is now the set a seed
    #   MAY draw from: a larger allowlist buys VARIETY, not size, and holding a
    #   measured route back no longer protects the pool -- it only makes every
    #   seed produce the same lineup. `active=False` keeps its ONE remaining
    #   meaning (Requirement 10.3): a route excluded from every draw regardless
    #   of seed, for a reason of its own.
    #
    #   THE BISECT HISTORY BELOW IS KEPT DELIBERATELY. It cost several ISO
    #   builds and in-game load tests to learn, it is the evidence the 90.4%
    #   occupancy budget is derived from, and none of it is reproducible from the
    #   code. It describes the world as it was while `active` was the size
    #   control; it does not describe which routes ship today.
    #
    #   All four passed the gated port path and verify_session's eight checks.
    #   That proves the in-memory buffers are STRUCTURALLY CONSISTENT. It says
    #   NOTHING about whether the console can hold or load them. The cumulative
    #   seven-route cost measured into GRAVE was:
    #     GRAVE.PRS  2,563,126 -> 5,123,325 B  (+2.56 MB, roughly double)
    #     GRAVE.PRT    817,232 -> 1,619,328 B  (+0.80 MB)
    #     mesh entries 39 -> 50, anim records 53 -> 115,
    #     .PRT textures 35 -> 54, BEF entries 70 -> 77
    #   PS2 has 32 MB main RAM and only 4 MB of VRAM for framebuffers plus all
    #   resident textures, so the .PRT growth is a separate and harder budget
    #   than the .PRS growth. The failure mode is therefore a RUNTIME RESOURCE
    #   LIMIT, not a structural defect - which is exactly why verify_session
    #   staying green cannot clear these routes.
    #
    #   The entries are kept, with their measurements intact, so the evidence is
    #   not lost and so the user can BISECT: flip ONE route's active=False to
    #   active=True, build, and see whether GRAVE still loads.

    #       0x19 Swamp_Zombie      +359,716 / +110,656   (2 mesh, 4 tex, 10 anim)
    #       0x58 Crazed_Prisoner   +411,500 / +84,000    (1 mesh, 2 tex, 12 anim)
    #       0x3A PirateSkeleton    +458,624 / +117,808   (1 mesh, 3 tex, 15 anim)
    #     ALL SEVEN (this build CRASHED on GRAVE level load):
    #                              +2,560,199 / +801,792
    #   So the level-load ceiling lies somewhere above +1.24 MB and at or below
    #   +2.56 MB of .PRS growth (and above +0.34 MB, at or below +0.80 MB of
    #   .PRT growth). Nothing narrower is known, which is exactly what the
    #   bisect is for.
    #
    #   For the record, no COUNT cap was found in MAXDEMOR.ELF that any of these
    #   numbers approach: LoadAnimResTable (vaddr 0x00167F00) reads its record
    #   count and calls new(count*4) with only a zero check, no bound; the one
    #   texture-side bound found is an assert at vaddr 0x001A6178,
    #   slti $v0, $v1, 175, i.e. the 175-slot CLUT table (GRAVE goes 34 -> 53
    #   CLUTs with all seven, nowhere near it). Absence of a count cap is why
    #   the suspicion is total allocation, not table length.
    #
    # --- added by the exhaustive GRAVE-route measurement ---------------------
    # Every candidate route into GRAVE (every WALKING_MELEE_POOL enemy not
    # native to GRAVE, once per world it IS native to) was driven through the
    # UNMODIFIED gated path: a fresh WorldPortSession per route, a synthetic
    # PlacementPlan(path=PORT), then verify_session. 16 routes enumerated, 7
    # passed, 9 refused. NO GATE WAS RELAXED for any of them; the four entries
    # below are exactly the passing routes that were not already listed.
    # The 9 refusals, recorded rather than fixed (both causes are pre-existing
    # and out of scope here):
    #   * 8 refused by texture_port's OPACITY_MAP-on-non-indexed (fmt=1) case
    #     -- SINCE FIXED AND RE-MEASURED, see the block after 0x58 below --
    #     which makes the following .PRT entry's start undeterminable:
    #     Plant_Monster 0x08 (castle entry 44, swamp entry 27), Frozen_Zombie
    #     0x10 and Snowman 0x1D and Bomb_Skeleton 0x49 (ice entry 11),
    #     Hammer_Devil 0x27 and Bomb_Skeleton 0x49 and Doomed_Soul 0x5D
    #     (under entry 3). Fixing that one texture case would unblock 8 routes,
    #     though 0x49 already has a passing CASTLE source.
    #   * 1 refused by the source-side mesh-table walk: Goat_Devil 0x13's
    #     UNDER.PRS mesh[38] sits after a top-level resync at entries 33-38 and
    #     does not round-trip in isolation (2408 B slice, 132 consumed).
    #   * 0 refused by the reference_integrity texture-remap hole (measured on
    #     0x44 / 0x5E during the companion investigation): neither of those ids
    #     is in WALKING_MELEE_POOL, so no GRAVE enemy route hits it today.

    # is declared_size + w*h (the colour block plus a ONE-BYTE-PER-PIXEL alpha
    # block), proven twice over - walking all 11 .PRT files with the rule
    # consumes each one exactly (entries == count_b, zero trailing bytes), and
    # the engine's own loader reads exactly w*h further bytes when flags & 2 is
    # set (MAXDEMOR.ELF: andi 2 at vaddr 0x001A62EC, w*h computed at
    # 0x001A634C-0x001A6360, malloc at 0x001A636C, sequential Read at

    # randomizer/texture_port.py's module docstring.
    # None of the routes below actually PORT an opacity-map entry - every
    # texture they inject is indexed (CLUT count grows by exactly the texture
    # count on each) - they only needed to WALK PAST one to reach a higher
    # indexed entry, which is why PirateSkeleton 0x3A (ICE textures 8-10, all

    # --- WHY ACTIVATION IS NOW SAFE, WHEN IT WAS NOT DURING THE BISECT -------
    #
    # 0x16, 0x27 and 0x5D were flipped to active=True here, and 0x08 was NOT.
    # The reason activation stopped being dangerous is a change in what `active`
    # controls, not new evidence about these three routes.
    #
    # DURING THE BISECT there was NO BUDGET ENFORCEMENT ANYWHERE. load_allowlist()
    # returned the shipped set: every active route was ported into every
    # cross-world build, the resident .PRS+.PRT total was whatever that summed
    # to, and nothing checked it against the RESOURCE pool. Pool exhaustion is
    # invisible - MemoryPool::Allocate falls through and returns
    # sentinel_block + 16, so the caller corrupts allocator metadata and the game
    # dies at level load with no log line, no build failure and no test failure.
    # So `active` WAS the only size control there was, and holding routes back
    # was the only way to stay inside the pool. That is why the seven-route build
    # crashed and why four routes went to active=False.
    #
    # NOW admission bounds the LIVE resident total. randomizer/roster_selection.py
    # walks a seed-fixed order and admits a group ONLY while
    # len(session.prs) + len(session.prt) plus that route's MEASURED cost still
    # fits pool_budget(raised=...) = 90.4% of the pool in effect. The bound is a
    # MEASUREMENT taken between group commits, not a sum of predictions, so a
    # route that costs more than its row says cannot overshoot: the next
    # admission reads the true size. Therefore:
    #
    #     ACTIVATING A ROUTE NO LONGER MEANS IT SHIPS IN EVERY BUILD.
    #     A LARGER ALLOWLIST BUYS VARIETY, NOT SIZE.
    #
    # And variety is exactly what was missing: with only the seven routes that
    # were active before this, every seed converged on the SAME lineup, because
    # the limit was the ALLOWLIST and not the budget. With the ten measured
    # routes allowlisted, 40 sampled seeds produced 6-7 foreign arrivals, 22
    # distinct resident totals and a peak occupancy of 90.32% - inside the band
    # every loading build came in at.
    #
    # WHAT WAS *NOT* ACTIVATED, and why:
    #   * 0x08 Plant_Monster stays active=False. It is MEASURED TO REFUSE as a
    #     group on the prs_mesh_parser top-level resync gap (companion 0x0B needs
    #     CASTLE.PRS mesh[49]), exactly like 0x53 Dark_Knight. It could safely be
    #     active - a refusal costs an enemy, not a build, and the walk backfills
    #     the budget it did not spend - but it has never been in a build and one
    #     known refusal (0x53, which Requirement 5.5 keeps deliberately) is
    #     enough. Not suspicion: it is simply not useful yet.
    #   * 0x53 Dark_Knight stays active=True and stays refusing. NOT worked
    #     around (Requirement 5.5).
    #   * 0x10 Frozen_Zombie and 0x13 Goat_Devil get NO ENTRY AT ALL. Neither
    #     could be measured (an anim-rig bind failure and the same mesh resync
    #     gap), so roster_costs.cost_for returns None and the selector excludes
    #     them regardless (Requirement 3.6).
    #
    # NOTHING HERE IS PROMOTED. All ten active routes remain CANDIDATE. Bytes,
    # measurements and draws are not render confirmations; only the user seeing
    # an enemy render correctly promotes a route (Requirement 10.4).

    # =======================================================================
    # MULTI-WORLD TARGETS, STAGE 1: ICE and SWAMP.
    #
    # GRAVE STOPS BEING THE ONLY TARGET HERE, and nothing about the mechanism
    # changed to allow it. `plan_draw`, `selection_rng`, `AdmissionGate`,
    # `lineup_by_world`, `ported_types_by_world` and `sound_port.merge_for_lineup`
    # were already per-target-world; the reason only grave had entries was that
    # only grave had MEASURED COST ROWS. It now has company:
    # `roster_costs.ROUTE_COSTS` carries 13 rows into ICE and 10 into SWAMP,
    # every one driven fresh through the unmodified gated path against that
    # world's OWN pristine archives, one route per process.
    #
    # WHY THESE TWO AND NOT ALL FOUR (research/MULTI_WORLD_TARGET_BUDGET_
    # MEASUREMENT.md §5). MEASURED pool headroom against
    # `pool_budget(raised=True)` = 6,635,388 B: ICE 2,398,271 B (~4 median
    # arrivals, up to 10 cheap), SWAMP 1,937,684 B (~3, up to 8). UNDER
    # (1,641,427 B) and CASTLE (802,663 B) are LATER STAGES and deliberately have
    # NO ENTRIES AND NO ROWS -- an absent target cannot be drawn by accident.
    #
    # THE RESOURCE POOL NEEDED NO PER-WORLD CHANGE, and that was CONFIRMED
    # rather than assumed: the pool ceiling is ABSOLUTE (one hard-coded pool,
    # `MemoryManager::__ct` @0x00191F40) and a `WorldPortSession` starts at the
    # TARGET WORLD'S OWN vanilla size, so `AdmissionGate` reading the live
    # `len(prs) + len(prt)` self-adjusts: ICE starts 856,759 B fuller than grave
    # and therefore admits fewer arrivals, with no new constant.
    #
    # SOUND IS A DIFFERENT STORY AND IT IS A REFUSAL. MEASURED roundup64 bank
    # occupancies against the 1,966,080 B `SPU_USABLE_CEILING`: SWAMP.BD leaves
    # 13,888 B and ICE.BD leaves 3,584 B, so the existing per-unit ceiling check
    # refuses almost every import. That is CORRECT and is LOGGED; no ceiling and
    # no headroom constant was moved.
    #
    # THE FOUR FIRST-PORT ROUTES into ICE -- 0x2F, 0x37, 0x48, 0x6A, all GRAVE
    # natives never ported anywhere before -- ALL COMMITTED and all verify green.
    #
    # ONE ROUTE COMMITTED AND IS STILL NOT HERE: 0x08 Plant_Monster into ICE. It
    # ports, but `verify_session` reports appended ICE mesh[41] carrying
    # surviving CASTLE-local texture ids (46 where 48 was assigned, 47 where 49
    # was). The same route into GRAVE verifies clean, so this is a per-TARGET
    # finding. Its cost row exists and states the failure; NO ENTRY IS GRANTED,
    # which excludes it for every seed without inventing a new permission path.
    #
    # EVERYTHING BELOW IS CANDIDATE AND NOTHING IS PROMOTED. Nobody has watched
    # a single one of these render.

    # =======================================================================
    # MULTI-WORLD TARGETS, STAGE 2: UNDER and CASTLE -- the last two worlds.
    #
    # ALL FIVE WORLDS ARE TARGETS AS OF HERE, and again nothing about the
    # mechanism changed to allow it. `plan_draw(seed, target_world, ...)`,
    # `selection_rng`, `AdmissionGate`, `lineup_by_world`, `ported_types_by_world`
    # and the per-target loop in `cli.py` were already target-agnostic; what
    # these two worlds were missing was MEASURED COST ROWS, and
    # `roster_costs.ROUTE_COSTS` now carries 10 into UNDER and 8 into CASTLE.
    # Every one was driven fresh through the unmodified gated path with
    # `--target under` / `--target castle`, ONE ROUTE PER PROCESS, against that
    # world's OWN pristine archives. No grave row was re-labelled: a row is per
    # (enemy, source, TARGET) and a grave row does not transfer.
    #
    # MEASURED headroom against `roster_selection.pool_budget(raised=True)` =
    # 6,635,388 B. UNDER's vanilla resident total is 4,993,961 B (68%), leaving
    # 1,641,427 B -- about 2-3 median arrivals. CASTLE's is 5,832,725 B, which is
    # 79%, THE TIGHTEST WORLD IN THE GAME, leaving 802,663 B: one arrival always,
    # a second only for a cheap pair. THAT AFFORDABILITY WAS MEASURED INTO
    # CASTLE, not inferred from grave -- the two cheapest CASTLE-measured routes
    # are 0x0D (301,572 B) and 0x19 (488,507 B), 790,079 B together, fitting by
    # 12,584 B. Costs are not additive, so the live `len(prs) + len(prt)` at
    # admission is still the authority and no build relies on that sum.
    #
    # SOUND IS IMPOSSIBLE IN BOTH, AND BOTH ARE REFUSED IN THE SOUND PATH RATHER
    # THAN LEFT SILENTLY EMPTY (`sound_port.merge_for_lineup`, refusing by NAME
    # OF THE MEASUREMENT, not by name of the world). UNDER.BD's roundup64
    # occupancy is 1,975,104 B, 9,024 B ABOVE `sound_bank.SPU_USABLE_CEILING`
    # BEFORE any import. CASTLE.BD is 10,688 B above it AND carries nSFX 299
    # against the driver's hard `< 300` (`sound_bank.MAX_SFX`), i.e. ZERO free
    # entry slots, so an import there is structurally impossible at ANY byte
    # size. NO CONSTANT WAS RAISED and no check was skipped: the reverb-off
    # argument that would legalise these banks is INFERRED from a call-graph
    # absence, and the StreamMemoryEnd writers at SLUS_200.17 VA 0x00141714 /
    # 0x00141858 are untraced. BOTH WORLDS ARE ASSETS ONLY.
    #
    # ONE MEASURED ROUTE GETS NO ENTRY: 0x08 Plant_Monster into UNDER. It
    # commits, but `verify_session` reports appended UNDER mesh[40] carrying
    # surviving CASTLE-local texture ids (46 where 48 was assigned, 47 where 49
    # was) -- the SAME defect the ICE route shows, and absent from the GRAVE
    # route, so it is a per-TARGET finding. Its cost row exists and states the
    # failure; no entry is granted, which excludes it for every seed.
    #
    # 0x13 Goat_Devil IS ELIGIBLE INTO CASTLE AND IS NOW SHIPPED, ON EXPLICIT
    # USER REQUEST, WITH ITS CRASH STILL UNEXPLAINED. Its entry below carries
    # active=True. The enemy-level hold mechanism
    # (`HELD_BACK_ENEMIES_ON_OBSERVED_CRASH`) is still wired and still
    # target-independent; it is simply EMPTY, so re-arming the hold is one
    # integer plus active=False.
    #
    # EVERYTHING BELOW IS CANDIDATE AND NOTHING IS PROMOTED. Nobody has watched a
    # single one of these render.

#: Routes held back for a reason that is NOT a measured refusal: the user
#: OBSERVED THEM CRASH OR MISRENDER ON HARDWARE while every structural check in
#: this repo stayed green.
#:
#: Until now there was exactly one legitimate reason to park a route -- it is
#: measured to REFUSE -- because under seeded selection admission bounds the
#: live resident total, so activating a committing route costs variety, not
#: size. That rule is still right for SIZE. It is wrong for CORRECTNESS: a
#: route can commit, verify green on all eight checks, and still hang the
#: console, and when that happens the only honest state is HELD BACK. A route
#: listed here MUST carry ``active=False`` and a note that says what was
#: measured and what was ruled out, so the hold-back stays a recorded
#: hypothesis rather than a shrug.
#:
#: THE SET IS CURRENTLY EMPTY, AND NOT BECAUSE THE DEFECT WAS UNDERSTOOD.
#: `0x13` Goat_Devil was its ONLY member. It was REMOVED ON EXPLICIT USER
#: INSTRUCTION: the user asked for the goat back knowing it hard-froze their
#: console at spawn, and is testing it themselves. NO ROOT CAUSE WAS FOUND AND
#: NOTHING WAS FIXED. The mechanism and its rationale below are UNCHANGED and
#: stay fully wired, so the hold can be re-armed in one line:
#: put the enemy id back in this frozenset (``frozenset({0x13})``) and set its
#: AllowEntry rows back to ``active=False``.
#:
#: ROOT CAUSE FOUND FOR THE NON-ATTACKING GOAT (a SEPARATE defect from the
#: spawn freeze below, and this one IS fixed). The anim port collected only the
#: indices carried by cat-2 material refs. Goat_Devil's refs are anims
#: 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 -- a CONTIGUOUS 77..88 block with
#: HOLES at 78 and 83 -- while its script drives `SeqPlay` slots 0..12. A clip
#: reached only through a `SeqPlay` slot number carries no material ref, so 78
#: and 83 were dropped; worse, dropping interior entries COMPACTED the block, so
#: every clip after each hole shifted down and every later slot played the wrong
#: animation. That is the "animation that attacks me is missing" report.
#: Measured: anims 78 and 83 are referenced by NO entry in UNDER.BEF, both
#: extract cleanly (9,207 B and 16,724 B), and between them they address ZERO
#: bone names absent from the ten records already shipping -- so they bind
#: exactly as well and add no refusal risk. `companion_port` now fills interior
#: holes in an entity's own referenced range, restricted to indices no other
#: entry references, which leaves another entity's index alone (e.g. UNDER 0x5E
#: fills nothing and leaves 54..64 untouched). Cost: +25,931 B .PRS for the goat.
#:
#: `0x13` Goat_Devil, as recorded: broken mesh/texture then a hard freeze, ALWAYS at spawn.
#: Its render-pass texture ids and its LOCAL CATEGORY-1/CATEGORY-2 refs were
#: both measured to be fully inside GRAVE's index space under BOTH appended
#: mesh entries, its 10 appended anim records are all BY_NAME with every name
#: resolving, and its companion closure is provably empty. No mechanism found;
#: see the entry's note for the figures.
#:
#: THE HOLD IS ON THE ENEMY, SO IT FOLLOWS THE ENEMY -- AND IT IS NOW WRITTEN
#: THAT WAY. This used to be a literal set of `(enemy, source, target)` TRIPLES,
#: which had a defect that only showed up as targets were added: the hold had to
#: be RE-TYPED for every new world, and a route into a world nobody had listed
#: yet was permitted by DEFAULT. That is backwards for an unexplained hard
#: freeze. The rule is stated once, on the ENEMY, below.
#:
#: WHY ENEMY-LEVEL IS THE HONEST SCOPE. `0x13` has now been measured into FOUR
#: targets (grave, ice, swamp, castle). All four COMMIT with byte-identical
#: deltas and all four pass every `verify_session` check -- which is exactly the
#: state the grave route was in when it hard-froze the console. So the evidence
#: says the defect is NOT a property of the target world and NOT anything the
#: structural checks can see; it is in the enemy or in its port. Porting it into
#: a fifth world would therefore very likely reproduce the freeze, and a clean
#: measurement is not an explanation. That reasoning is unchanged: anything
#: added here ships NOWHERE, for every world, including worlds not yet
#: measured. `0x13` is no longer here only because the user overrode the hold.

    The built-in CROSS_WORLD_ALLOWLIST entries with ``active=True`` only. An
    entry with ``active=False`` is defined and documented but takes no part in
    a build: it never reaches allowlist_lookup, so no placement can be granted
    on it, for every seed (Requirement 10.3).

    WHAT ``active`` MEANS NOW, AND WHY IT CHANGED
    --------------------------------------------
    This used to be the SHIPPED SET: every active route was ported into every
    cross-world build, so ``active`` doubled as a size control and the set was
    kept deliberately small while the GRAVE level-load crash was bisected. That
    is no longer true. ``randomizer/roster_selection.py`` draws a SEED-CHOSEN,
    BUDGET-BOUNDED subset of the allowlist per build, and admission bounds the
    LIVE resident total (``len(session.prs) + len(session.prt)``) against
    ``pool_budget`` before each group commits. So this dict is now the set of
    routes a seed MAY draw, not the set a build ships:

        a larger allowlist buys VARIETY, not size.

    That is precisely what the bisect era lacked - back then there was no budget
    enforcement of any kind, so activating a route did grow every build and a
    seventh route did crash the console. The bound, not the flag, is what keeps a
    build inside the pool now.

    THE ACTIVE SET IS 0x0D, 0x16, 0x19, 0x1D, 0x27, 0x3A, 0x49, 0x53, 0x58 AND
    0x5D - the ten allowlisted routes into GRAVE that ``roster_costs`` MEASURED.
    Nine of them commit; 0x53 Dark_Knight is measured to REFUSE as a group and
    stays active deliberately, because a refusal costs an enemy and never a
    build (Requirement 5.1) and the walk's next candidate backfills the budget
    it did not spend (Requirement 5.4).

    HELD BACK: 0x08 Plant_Monster only. It is measured to refuse as a group on
    the same ``prs_mesh_parser`` top-level resync gap as 0x53 (its companion
    0x0B needs CASTLE.PRS mesh[49]), and unlike 0x53 it has never been in a
    build at all, so it stays out until someone wants a second known refusal in
    the draw. Nothing about it is suspected; it is simply not useful yet.

    NOT ALLOWLISTED AT ALL: 0x10 Frozen_Zombie and 0x13 Goat_Devil. Both were
    driven and neither could be measured (an anim-rig bind failure and the mesh
    resync gap respectively), so ``roster_costs.cost_for`` returns ``None`` for
    them and the selector excludes them anyway (Requirement 3.6). An entry would
    add nothing but a second way to say no.

    STATUS IS UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THIS. Every entry is CANDIDATE. Measuring a
    route, activating it and drawing it are all evidence about BYTES; only the
    user watching an enemy render correctly promotes anything to CONFIRMED
    (Requirement 10.4).

    THE BISECT HISTORY, kept because it cost a lot to learn. 0x16 Axe_Guard was
    step one and that build LOADED; 0x3A PirateSkeleton was step two and that
    build LOADED too, at +1.79 MB .PRS / +0.61 MB .PRT. Adding 0x1D Snowman on
    top of it crashed, but that was CONFOUNDED with size, so 0x3A - a pure size
    probe - was held back to make Snowman the only new variable. That five-route
    build (0x0D, 0x16, 0x1D, 0x49, 0x53, +1,663,193 .PRS / +609,504 .PRT) LOADED,
    which exonerated Snowman and attributed the six-route crash to cumulative
    size. Every held-back decision in that history was taken WITHOUT a budget;
    with one, the same routes are safe to allowlist because no build ships all
    of them.

    A user-supplied JSON overlay that could add CANDIDATE entries is deferred
    to (optional) Task 9 and is deliberately NOT implemented here.

    CURRENT STATE, WHICH SUPERSEDES THE GRAVE-ONLY PARAGRAPHS ABOVE. The
    allowlist now spans THREE TARGET WORLDS: 13 routes into GRAVE, 12 into ICE
    and 10 into SWAMP. 0x10 Frozen_Zombie and 0x13 Goat_Devil DO have entries
    (both became measurable -- the first through an ELF measurement of the
    engine's own bind loop, the second through the prs_mesh_parser field-offset
    correction), and 0x08 Plant_Monster's GRAVE route commits and is active. The
    only routes held back are 0x13's THREE, all listed in
    HELD_BACK_ON_OBSERVED_CRASH: it commits and verifies green everywhere and
    still froze the console in game.

    The key is per (enemy, source, TARGET), so the same enemy can be permitted
    into several worlds independently, and `allowlist_lookup(enemy, target)`
    resolves per target.

    STAGE 2 ADDED UNDER AND CASTLE, so ALL FIVE WORLDS ARE NOW TARGETS: 13
    routes into GRAVE, 12 into ICE, 10 into SWAMP, 9 into UNDER and 7 into
    CASTLE. The paragraph above that said UNDER and CASTLE have no entries is
    superseded -- what they lacked was MEASURED COST ROWS, and
    `roster_costs.ROUTE_COSTS` now carries 10 rows into UNDER and 8 into CASTLE,
    each driven fresh through the unmodified gated path against that world's own
    pristine archives. Two measured routes still get NO ENTRY:
    `(0x08, "castle", "under")`, which commits but fails `verify_session` on
    surviving source-local texture ids exactly as it does into ICE, and every
    `0x13` route, held back on the enemy-level observed-crash rule below.

    THE OBSERVED-CRASH HOLD IS ENFORCED HERE TOO, ON THE ENEMY. An entry for an
    enemy in ``HELD_BACK_ENEMIES_ON_OBSERVED_CRASH`` is dropped whatever its
    ``active`` flag says, for every target world including ones nobody has
    measured yet. The data already says ``active=False`` for all of them; this is
    the second lock, so a future entry cannot hand that enemy a permission by a
    single-field slip.

# WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY (Req 4.2, Req 4.5, Req 2.5, Req 3.1)
#   92 routes have been driven in all: Task 3's 64, of which 62 committed and
#   verified, plus the 28 PHASE-2 routes, of which all 28 did. This table carries
#   all 90.
#     * The only 2 absences are MEASURED AND REFUSED: `0x6C` Coin_Container
#       under->grave and under->swamp both ported and then failed
#       `verify_session` on surviving source-world texture ids (refusal S5). A
#       refused route gets no row, and that stays true -- a refusal is EVIDENCE,
#       not policy, so it is not the user's to waive.
#   A missing row is therefore an EXCLUSION for every seed, which is stronger
#   than `active=False` and needs no second permission path.
#
# THE 16 WITHHELD ROUTES ARE NOW HERE, BECAUSE THE HOLD WAS POLICY.
#   This table used to carry 46. `0x17` Smashable_Snow_Pirate, `0xAD`
#   Spirit_Torch, `0x50` Standing_Coffin and `0xBC` Smashable_Coffin were held
#   back with all 16 of their routes MEASURED CLEAN and `verify_session` green
#   -- the hold was this repo's caution about what a foreign copy might DO in
#   game, not any port failure. The user asked for these four explicitly and
#   ACCEPTED THE RISK that one breaks in game, so their rows are admitted.
#   Every one is `CANDIDATE` and UNOBSERVED, and what is still unsettled is
#   recorded per source in `roster.STRUCTURE_HOLD_LIFTED`: for `0x17` / `0xAD`,
#   WHICH game var index their single `GameVarSet` touches and whether any world
#   reads it; for `0x50` / `0xBC`, WHAT A FOREIGN COFFIN ACTUALLY DROPS
#   (design.md open question 2). Their closures' progression anchors `0x2B`
#   Gold_Key and `0x65` were REUSED, never injected, so the PORT adds no anchor
#   to any world -- the drop is the open question, not the port.
#
#   THIS WIDENS SOURCES ONLY. No destination protection is weakened by it:
#   PROTECTED_TAGS, PROTECTED_INSTANCE_NAMES, the `end*` kill-groups, the
#   Gold_Key / Level_Column / Skeleton_Key / Monster_Generator anchors and
#   `items.HAZARD_PROTECTED_AS_SOURCE` all still run unchanged in the item pass,
#   and `HELD_BACK_ENEMIES_ON_OBSERVED_CRASH` is untouched.
#
#   THE PHASE-2 SEVEN ARE NOW MEASURED, SO THEY HAVE ROWS: 62 -> 90.
#   `0x01`, `0x02`, `0x0A` (progression, Req 3.4) and `0xAE`, `0xB5`, `0xC8`,
#   `0xD3` (Ordered_Puzzle_Props, Req 3.3) had their POLICY hold lifted with
#   nothing measured, so Req 4.2 kept them out of this table. All 28 of their
#   routes have since been driven through the same unmodified gated path, one per
#   child process: 28 COMMITTED, `verify_session` green on all 28, ZERO refusals.
#   The rows appear here BECAUSE the cost rows exist, not because the hold went;
#   the derivation below is what makes that structural.
#   MEASUREMENT ANSWERS ONLY THE ASSET QUESTION. Whether a foreign Bone Tower
#   assembles, where a foreign Bonus Grave leads, whether a Popup Headstone ever
#   pops up, and whether an arrival disturbs an S_SUB3 / U_SUB3 numbered chain
#   are all still open, recorded per source in `roster.STRUCTURE_HOLD_LIFTED`.
#   Every one of the 28 is `CANDIDATE` and UNOBSERVED.
#
#   STILL EXCLUDED, and not part of this: `0x5F` Monster_Generator (GLOBAL
#   assets, Req 2.4), whose exclusion is MEASURED and not the user's to waive.

# IMPORTANT CORRECTION: every world actually ships its own .PRS/.PRT pair
# on the retail disc (GRAVE.PRS, UNDER.PRS, ICE.PRS/ICE_B.PRS, SWAMP.PRS/
# SWAMP_B.PRS, CASTLE.PRS/CASTLE_K.PRS/CASTLE_Q.PRS), in addition to
# GLOBAL.PRS. An earlier version of this comment claimed ICE/SWAMP/CASTLE
# had "no separate PRS" and treated their world-exclusive monsters as
# cross-world-safe — that was never verified and is contradicted by the
# files on disc. Any enemy that's only native to 1-2 worlds is almost
# certainly stored in that world's own PRS, not GLOBAL.PRS, and must be
# locked here. Only enemies natively used in 3+ worlds (strong evidence of
# a shared/global mesh, since it would be wasteful to duplicate the same
# monster's assets into 3+ separate per-world PRS files) are left unlocked.
# DEPRECATED / UNUSED. Kept only as an empty set so any stale import keeps
# working. It is NOT part of the eligibility path any more: cross-world
# permission now comes from allowlist_lookup(), never from subtracting a
# lock set. Do not add ids here — add an AllowEntry instead.

#   - 0x0D (Zombie_Crocodile) is only in SWAMP.BEF but works perfectly in
#     GRAVE_CROSSWORLD.BEF (zero byte modifications to the blob).
#   - 0x16 (Axe_Guard) is only in CASTLE.BEF and also works in GRAVE_CROSSWORLD.
# Both enemies render correctly because ALL enemy meshes are in GLOBAL.PRS,
# not in world-specific PRS files. World-specific PRS files contain only
# level geometry, particles, and prop textures — not enemy meshes.
# inject_cross_world_enemies copies blobs as-is (remap_blob_textures is a no-op),

# This is the target-BLIND union of every enemy id that appears anywhere in
# CROSS_WORLD_ALLOWLIST. It answers "is this enemy allowed to cross into ANY
# world at all", NOT "may it cross into THIS world". Membership here does not
# permit a single placement.
#
# Why flattening is nonetheless safe here:
#   (a) It can only ever NARROW a candidate pool by intersection; it cannot
#       grant a placement, because nothing downstream places an enemy on the

#
# Any caller that needs a world-correct answer MUST use
# get_walking_melee_for_world(world, cross_world=True) (or allowlist_lookup
# directly). Trusting a flat, target-blind set is precisely the bug class that
# put unported enemies into maps — the old
# `UNIVERSAL_WALKING_MELEE - PRS_LOCKED_ENEMIES` derivation admitted all 21
# walking-melee types into every world. Do not reintroduce it.
