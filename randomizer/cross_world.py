"""Cross-world enemy placement orchestration.

This module is the single decision point for "may this enemy be placed into
this world, and what has to happen for it to render?". It owns:

  * classification of every candidate placement into exactly one outcome
    (see ``classify_placement`` and the path constants below), and
  * reading the shared-texture-cache boundary out of ``GLOBAL.PRT``.

The porting machinery itself (``WorldPortSession``, ``run_cross_world_placements``,
``verify_session``, fallback handling) lands in later tasks and will live here too.

Two facts about the file formats drive the whole design:

A BLOB NAMES ITS RESOURCES IN ITS MATERIAL SECTION, NOT AT OFFSET 22
    ``[blob+0x20, blob+0x24)`` is framed ``[record_count u32]`` then per record
    ``[len u32][body]``, and each body opens with one or two 5-byte references
    ``[rec_type u8][u32 = flag<<24 | index]``: index = bits 0-23, category =
    bits 24-30, is_global = bit 31. rec_type 0x05 carries CATEGORY 1, which is a
    POSITIONAL index into that world's ``.PRS`` MESH TABLE; rec_type 0x04
    carries CATEGORY 2, an index into that world's ``.PRS`` ANIM TABLE. This
    walk parses all 359 blobs across all five worlds exactly, and in every world
    ``max_local_cat1 == mesh_count - 1``. Proof for the mesh half: Dark_Knight
    0x53's CASTLE cat-1 refs are 25, 25, 26, and CASTLE.PRS mesh[25] is the
    tag-6, 132,900-byte, 34-bone, 31-render-pass PSkeleton with textures exactly
    {33, 34} -- his mesh, identified independently.

    The mesh table is positional and per-world, so placing a foreign enemy means
    appending its referenced entries to the target ``.PRS`` and rewriting each
    LOCAL CATEGORY-1 reference to the new position, PRESERVING the flag byte.
    A GLOBAL reference (bit 31) is left strictly alone: that asset exists in
    every world already. The u16 at blob offset 22 remains discredited and is
    never read or written.

RENDER-PASS TEXTURE IDS ARE WORLD-LOCAL ``.PRT`` INDICES
    A mesh's render passes reference textures by DIRECT index into the world's
    OWN ``.PRT``, in file order. There is no global prefix in this field.

    This CORRECTS the research doc's Session 8 conclusion ("render-pass texture
    ids are ABSOLUTE cache indices; GLOBAL occupies 0..163 and world-local
    follows at ``global_tex_count + local``"). That model is DISPROVEN for this
    field, by measurement:

      * ``CASTLE.PRS`` mesh[10] and ``ICE.PRS`` mesh[18] are the SAME asset
        (identical 157,356-byte length, tag 6, 39 bones, 43 render passes) yet
        bind ids ``{9,10,11,12}`` in Castle and ``{21,22,23,24}`` in Ice.
        Extracting those eight ``.PRT`` entries shows they are pairwise
        BYTE-IDENTICAL -- same header fields (256x128 / 128x128 / 256x256 /
        256x256, format 0x13, size), same pixel bytes, same 1024-byte CLUTs.
        A global index would be the same number in both worlds; a world-local
        index is exactly what differs. The id indexes the world's own ``.PRT``.
      * Across all five worlds the maximum render-pass id found ANYWHERE is
        always below that world's own ``.PRT`` count_b and nowhere near 164:
        GRAVE max 34 / count_b 35, CASTLE 49 / 56, SWAMP 39 / 40, ICE 45 / 46,
        UNDER 41 / 46. Not one id in any world reaches its own count_b, and not
        one reaches GLOBAL.PRT's count of 164.

    Consequence for porting: EVERY render-pass texture id of a ported entry is
    SOURCE-WORLD-LOCAL and must be ported into the target ``.PRT`` and remapped
    to its new world-local slot. There is no "id below 164, leave it alone"
    case -- that branch is what made Dark_Knight's Castle ids 33/34 resolve to
    two unrelated GRAVE textures (GRAVE 33 is 128x128, CASTLE 33 is 256x128),
    i.e. the wrong-skin symptom. ``GLOBAL.PRT``'s count_b plays no part in this
    field's arithmetic; a new slot's index is simply the target ``.PRT``'s
    count_b immediately before the injection.

# --- FEATURE UNPARKED, HARD-GATED ------------------------------------------
# The .PRS mesh port path is ENABLED again, now driven by a blob's MATERIAL
# REFERENCES instead of the discredited u16@22. Every route still has to clear
# the gates in ``_port_enemy``:
#
#   * the blob's material section must walk exactly (record count and section
#     end both landing) -- ``bef.parse_material_refs`` raises otherwise;
#   * the TARGET .PRS mesh table must walk with ZERO resyncs and its walk end
#     must agree with the independent Anim-table anchor. This used to pass for
#     GRAVE alone, with CASTLE, SWAMP and UNDER landing 166-720 KB short of
#     their anchors -- which was NOT a property of those worlds but two wrong
#     field offsets in ``prs_mesh_parser`` (PSTAnim channel count u16@+0, not +2;
#     PVertexAnim element count u32@+4, not +0; see
#     research/PRS_MESH_TABLE_ENGINE_LAYOUTS.md). MEASURED NOW: all five worlds
#     walk their declared entry count with ZERO resyncs and land exactly on their
#     anchor, so all five PASS this gate. The gate is unchanged; only GRAVE is
#     actually targeted by the allowlist;
#   * every LOCAL CATEGORY-1 source entry must clear ``assess_source_entry``;
#   * no LOCAL CATEGORY-2 (anim) reference may point past the target world's
#     anim count -- see ``_check_local_anim_refs``.
#
# Any failure refuses the route and mutates nothing (all-or-nothing per enemy).
#
# HISTORICAL NOTE, kept because it cost a lot to learn:
# the premise the OLD path rested on was measured to be FALSE.
#
# ``mesh_port.MESH_INDEX_OFFSET = 22`` (a u16 in a BEF blob) was believed to be
# a positional index into the world's .PRS mesh table. It is not. Inside a
# single GRAVE.BEF, SEVEN native enemies all carry u16@22 = 25:
#   Zombie_Crocodile 0x0D, Axe_Skeleton 0x2F, Raven 0x37, Basic_Skeleton 0x47,
#   Guard_Skeleton 0x54, Torso_Zombie 0x6A, Ghost 0x6B
# Basic_Skeleton and Guard_Skeleton both render CORRECTLY in vanilla and look
# nothing alike, so 25 cannot be a shared model index. Three further natives
# share the value 30. The neighbouring u16@20 is not an entry tag either: it is
# 3 for 50 of 54 enemy entries and 6 for the other four, never 1.
#
# Consequence: every port this path performed extracted whatever object
# happened to occupy an unrelated index in a world mesh table, spliced it into
# the target .PRS, and rewrote a field that means something else entirely. The
# ports were byte-exact and the enemies did spawn -- wearing arbitrary props.
# GLOBAL.PRS is not the answer either: it holds tag-1 props at 25 and 30 and
# cannot even be walked (32 resyncs, the parse dies at entry 126 of 164 and
# finishes 965 KB short of its Anim-table anchor).
#
# Setting this back to False re-parks the whole path: ``port_enemy`` then
# refuses every route before reading a single source byte, ``iso_patcher``
# receives nothing, and the output is byte-identical to a cross-world-off run.
# It is a kill switch, not a tuning knob.
MESH_PORT_ENABLED = True

# --- HEURISTIC ANIMATION SUBSTITUTION --------------------------------------
# NOT A PORT. Anim entries cannot be extracted or inserted: a world's .PRS anim
# table holds records of MIXED types and only ~43% carry the ``TFA\xff`` magic
# (GRAVE declares 53 records, 23 signatures; CASTLE 109/38; SWAMP 78/23), the
# 0x0A u32 before each signature is a per-record TYPE TAG rather than a header
# constant, and no scannable marker exists for the other record types -- so
# entry boundaries are not derivable.
#
# What IS possible: point a ported enemy's LOCAL CATEGORY-2 references at the
# anim indices of a TARGET-WORLD NATIVE whose mesh has a similar bone count.
# Those indices are known to drive a real skeleton in that world already, so
# the enemy should move instead of sliding in its rest pose. The chosen
# animation is somebody else's, and a bone-count match is a proxy for skeleton
# compatibility, not a proof of it: the result may still be wrong. Every log
# line says so.
#
# With this False the module restores the previous behaviour exactly: in-range
# LOCAL CATEGORY-2 refs are left alone (and out-of-range ones still refuse the
# route). It is a switch, not a tuning knob -- no other logic reads it.
ANIM_SUBSTITUTION_ENABLED = True

# --- REAL ANIMATION PORTING (the enemy's OWN records) ----------------------
# This is a PORT, not the substitution above: the enemy's own anim records are
# appended to the target world's anim table and its LOCAL CATEGORY-2 references
# are repointed at the indices they land on. It is the path that CAN be correct,
# for a measured reason (`role-notes.md`, task 8.4): an SKA record addresses
# bones BY NAME, the four GRAVE donor natives use four mutually incompatible
# bone naming conventions, and so a BORROWED clip can never bind to a ported
# rig -- while an enemy's own clips name its own bones by construction.
#
# It is reachable ONLY where this switch is set AND ``anim_trust()`` passes for
# the target world (Requirement 9.3). Both halves matter: the switch is the
# human decision that the walker is trusted at all, the gate is the per-world
# evidence that this table can be walked, tiled and round-tripped.
#
# With it True and the gate passing for the target world, a refusal from the
# porter REFUSES THE ENEMY (Requirement 9.5). There is deliberately no fallback
# to the heuristic: falling back would place an enemy whose anim references were
# already rewritten by a path that then failed, which is precisely the
# partially-correct commit that desynchronises the engine's whole-table read.
#
# --- WHY THIS IS NOW True (task 11, the final checkpoint) ------------------
# It shipped False while the walker was unproven. It is True now because the
# evidence the switch was waiting for exists and was measured, not assumed:
#
#   * THE ANIM TRUST GATE PASSES FOR ALL FIVE WORLDS. ``assess_anim_table``
#     returns ok for GRAVE (53 records), CASTLE (109), SWAMP (78), ICE (82) and
#     UNDER (90): the walked count equals the declared count, the bounds tile
#     the region with no gap and no overlap, no walk event is raised, and every
#     record round-trips byte-identically. Nothing is scanned or resynced; the
#     cursor advances only by the ELF-derived per-tag ``record_length``.
#   * A REAL PORT IS PROVEN END TO END. Dark_Knight 0x53 on the actual
#     CASTLE->GRAVE route appends its OWN 11 anim records, taking GRAVE's
#     declared count 53 -> 64, with every appended record extracting back out
#     of the staged buffer byte-identically, the trailing bytes preserved, the
#     post-append re-walk clean, and ``verify_session`` passing every check.
#   * THE SUBSTITUTION HEURISTIC CANNOT BE CORRECT (role-notes.md, task 8.4).
#     An SKA record addresses bones BY NAME and the four GRAVE donor natives
#     use four mutually incompatible bone naming conventions, so a BORROWED
#     clip can never bind to a ported rig. An enemy's own clips name its own
#     bones by construction. Leaving the switch off keeps a path that is known
#     to be wrong; the reason this spec exists is that animations are wrong in
#     game, and a fix that is switched off cannot be confirmed in game.
#
# It REMAINS A KILL SWITCH. Setting it back to False restores the
# Substitution_Heuristic exactly: every enemy takes the heuristic branch
# including its out-of-range refusal, ``anim_trust()`` is never consulted, and
# not one anim byte is appended anywhere. Nothing else changed with the flip --
# no gate, refusal or heuristic code was relaxed to accommodate it.
#
# It is a kill switch, not a tuning knob -- no other logic reads it.
ANIM_PORT_ENABLED = True

# --- COMPANION ENTITY PORTING (the objects an enemy OWNS) ------------------
# Cross-world enemy porting itself now works in game: correct mesh, correct
# textures, and the enemy's OWN anim records appended by
# ``anim_port.port_anim_records``. A measured run placed 3 enemies with 0
# refusals, took GRAVE's declared anim count 53 -> 77 and its mesh count
# 39 -> 45, and ``verify_session`` passed all eight checks.
#
# What does NOT work is enemies that own ADDITIONAL OBJECTS. Bomb_Skeleton 0x49
# throws no bomb -- so it cannot damage the player at all -- and Dark_Knight
# 0x53 has no purple wall. That missing content is almost certainly not the
# enemy's own mesh entries: Bomb_Skeleton's CASTLE blob carries LOCAL
# CATEGORY-1 refs ``10 x8, 11 x2, 12 x1`` (three distinct indices, all ported)
# and Dark_Knight's are ``25, 25, 26`` (two distinct, both ported). The bomb and
# the wall are therefore believed to be SEPARATE entities that the enemy spawns
# at runtime.
#
# THE COMPANION RELATIONSHIP IS MEASURED. It was UNDER INVESTIGATION for a long
# time, and three methods failed: a separate-BEF-type-id pool (a pool, never an
# edge), a byte-value field scan inside the blob (a no-companion control enemy
# scored the same, and the only survivor was ``blob+0x10`` = the entry's own self
# id), and a level ``.PSX`` co-reference scan (a byte value that is not even a
# type id scored an order of magnitude higher). A FOURTH method did recover it:
# `randomizer/befscript.py` decodes every one of the game's 530 script sections
# at 100% coverage with 158 verified opcodes, and `49 CScriptApi::Spawn` takes
# the companion's BEF type id as a LITERAL push. Verdict
# `CANDIDATE_D_BYTECODE`; see
# ``.kiro/specs/companion-entity-porting/companion-notes.md``.
#
# --- WHY THIS IS NOW True (the completing pass) ----------------------------
# It shipped False while the edge was unproven and then while the SIZE CEILING
# was unbounded for a companion build. Both of those are now measured, not
# assumed:
#
#   * THE EDGE IS RECOVERED AND VERIFIED. `49 CScriptApi::Spawn`'s literal
#     operand, decoded with `befscript`'s 158-opcode ``verified`` map, names the
#     companion. All 11 allowlist routes were re-derived clean in one pass:
#     100% coverage, 0 refusals, 0 non-literal ``Spawn`` arguments, and the
#     seven previously measured sets all AGREE with the literals in
#     ``catalog.py``.
#   * THE BUILD IS MEASURED AND IT IS UNDER A PROVEN-GOOD FIGURE. The active set
#     built as ONE session (config A) measures **+1,538,265 .PRS / +565,584 .PRT
#     / +16,696 .BEF**. Both axes are UNDER the proven-good +1,987,430 /
#     +609,504, with .PRS 449,165 B under.
#   * IT IS CHEAPER THAN TODAY'S COMPANION-LESS BUILD. That build measures
#     +1,987,430 .PRS / +555,216 .PRT. Turning companions on makes 0x53 drop
#     out, and losing its +612,154 .PRS more than pays for the companions'
#     +162,989. So this does not approach the ceiling from either direction.
#
# THE TRADE. Dark_Knight 0x53 now REFUSES AS A WHOLE GROUP, so four enemies
# place instead of five. Its companion 0x8C needs ``CASTLE.PRS`` mesh[54], which
# sits after a TOP-LEVEL resync at entry 50, so ``assess_source_entry`` will not
# extract it. That is correct behaviour and nothing was relaxed to avoid it.
# Plant_Monster 0x08 would refuse for the same reason (its 0x0B needs mesh[49])
# if it were ever activated. Solving the ``prs_mesh_parser`` resync gap is the
# prerequisite for both.
#
# WHAT EACH ENEMY GAINS. Bomb_Skeleton 0x49 injects 0x5E -- the bomb, whose
# ``Spawn`` sits immediately after the throw sound effect -- plus 0x44 and 0xEB
# (the blast effects 0x5E itself spawns) and 0x63. Snowman 0x1D injects 0x1E,
# 0x9B and 0xBA (0x1E's mesh nodes are named ``snow_debris``,
# ``snow_debris#2..#8``). Zombie_Crocodile 0x0D and Crazed_Prisoner 0x58 are
# MEASURED to spawn nothing and are unaffected -- if either changes in game,
# something is wrong.
#
# THE SAFETY THAT MAKES THIS SURVIVABLE. Injection is APPEND-ONLY, via
# ``rebuild_with_injections(..., replace=False)``, so no progression anchor and
# no ``PROTECTED_TAGS`` entry can be touched. Each companion keeps its SOURCE
# type id, so the literal ``Spawn`` operand needs no rewrite. And
# ``CVmEntityManager::LoadBoundEntityFile`` aborts the load of the WHOLE .BEF if
# any single entry fails to parse -- which is why every staged blob is re-parsed
# before it is queued, and why anything unprovable is a refusal rather than a
# best effort.
#
# NOTHING HERE IS CONFIRMED. The bytecode proves WHAT each enemy spawns. It does
# not prove that 0x8C is the purple wall, or that 0x1E/0x9B/0xBA are the
# shockwave -- those were only ever named from mesh-node and call-site priors.
# Only the user seeing it in game settles that.
#
# TO REVERT: set this back to ``False``. One line, no other edit needed. With it
# False, every staged buffer is byte-identical to a run performed before this
# feature existed: no companion graph is walked, no companion blob is extracted,
# no BEF type id is allocated, and the CANDIDATE routes into GRAVE place exactly
# as they did. ``companion_memo`` and ``companion_blobs`` exist on every session
# but stay empty, and the three companion checks in ``verify_session`` iterate an
# empty list.
#
# It is a kill switch, not a tuning knob -- no other logic reads it. It is read
# at the companion entry point only: ``run_cross_world_placements`` chooses
# between ``_port_group_with_companions`` and the unchanged
# ``session.port_enemy``, and nothing else in the codebase mentions it.
COMPANION_PORT_ENABLED = True

# --- ONE-QUESTION EXPERIMENT HOOK (default OFF) ----------------------------
# This is NOT the companion feature and it is NOT a step towards it. It exists
# to answer ONE question that the Task 1 investigation left ``UNRESOLVED``:
#
#   is the "enemy X spawns object Y" reference made BY TYPE ID?
#
# If it is, then injecting a CASTLE-only entity into GRAVE under its ORIGINAL
# type id makes an unrewritten spawn reference resolve WITHOUT anyone having
# decoded the spawn instruction (design.md's Requirement 5.3 leverage). That is
# observable in game: port Bomb_Skeleton 0x49 into GRAVE as usual, additionally
# inject 0xEB (the mesh-adjacency BOMB PRIOR, and one of the 10 CASTLE-only ids
# no CASTLE level ever places) as a STANDALONE entity keeping id 0xEB, and look
# at whether the bomb appears. A bomb means the edge is by type id; no bomb
# means it is not, and the ``bef-script-vm-disassembler`` work is unavoidable.
#
# When non-empty, each listed type id is ported from
# ``COMPANION_EXPERIMENT_SOURCE_WORLD`` into ``COMPANION_EXPERIMENT_TARGET_WORLD``
# through the UNMODIFIED ``WorldPortSession.port_enemy`` path -- same trust
# gates, same mesh/texture/anim porters, same append-only BEF injection. No gate
# is relaxed for it: an id that refuses is refused, exactly like an allowlisted
# enemy. It bypasses ONLY ``classify_placement``, whose pool/allowlist tests are
# about ENEMY PLACEMENT and are meaningless for an entity nothing places.
#
# TO TURN IT OFF, set the tuple back to ``()``. That restores byte-identical
# output: no extra blob is read, no extra mesh/anim/texture is appended, and no
# BEF entry is injected.
#
# THE EXPERIMENT WAS RUN with ``(0xEB,)`` and is now SPENT. It ported cleanly
# (both trust gates PASS, CASTLE.PRS mesh[13] 21,820 B, 2 world-local textures,
# its own anim record appended, append-only BEF injection, ``verify_session``
# passing all eight checks) and the user tested the build in game: STILL NO
# BOMB, no freeze, no crash. So presence in the target world's .BEF under the
# ORIGINAL type id is NOT sufficient for the spawn to resolve -- the edge is not
# a plain type-id lookup satisfied by BEF presence, and Requirement 5.3's
# leverage does not work as a standalone fix. The null is also consistent with
# "0xEB simply is not the bomb" (it was only a mesh-adjacency prior); repeating
# with 0x4F or 0x63 would distinguish wrong-candidate from wrong-mechanism.
# See ``.kiro/specs/companion-entity-porting/companion-notes.md``.
#
# The hook is RETAINED, EMPTY, purely so that follow-up is one edit away. It is
# left empty because a non-empty tuple would silently inject an unrelated entity
# into every future GRAVE build.
#
# ``COMPANION_PORT_ENABLED`` above is NOT read by this hook, and the hook is not
# read by the companion path -- the two are independent. Nothing here walks a
# companion graph, allocates a type id, or resolves an edge; the real edge is now
# recovered from bytecode and handled by ``companion_port``, which is what the
# switch above turns on.

    """Pick a target-world native that can COVER the ported enemy's anim slots.

    REASONING, in full, because this is the auditable heart of the heuristic:

    A ported enemy T-poses because its LOCAL CATEGORY-2 (anim) references name
    anim-table slots of ITS OWN world, and in the target world those slots hold
    either an unrelated animation or an animation authored against a different
    bone hierarchy, so nothing binds and the skeleton stays in its rest pose.
    Anim entries cannot be ported (boundaries are not derivable -- see
    ``ANIM_SUBSTITUTION_ENABLED``), so the only lever left is to point the
    ported enemy at anim slots that ALREADY drive a humanoid skeleton in the
    target world: those of the world's own natives.

    Which native? Bone count alone was tried first and was inadequate: it
    measures skeleton size but says nothing about how many clips the donor owns
    or what they mean. GRAVE's Ghost, a 3-slot hovering floater, kept winning
    for a 34-bone walking knight on bone proximity alone, which collapsed 9 of
    the knight's 11 anims onto a single hover clip -- every ref resolved, and
    the enemy still looked broken.

    So COVERAGE is now the primary key. When ``needed_slots`` is given (the
    number of DISTINCT local category-2 anim indices the ported enemy names),
    each candidate's shortfall is ``max(0, needed_slots - len(anim_indices))``
    and the lowest shortfall wins: a donor that can give every needed slot its
    own clip beats a donor with a closer bone count. Bone proximity is the
    TIEBREAK among equally-covering donors, then the lower enemy id purely for
    determinism. With ``needed_slots=None`` every shortfall is 0 and the legacy
    bone-only ordering applies unchanged.

    Bone count is still the only skeleton property measurable on both sides
    without parsing the skeleton itself, and an animation targets a specific
    joint list, so a similar joint count remains the best available proxy for
    "these two skeletons are close enough for the channels to land". It is a
    PROXY. Equal bone counts do not prove equal hierarchies or equal bone
    order, so the substituted animation may still play wrongly. This is a
    HEURISTIC SUBSTITUTION, NOT A PORT.

    Donor eligibility, all required:
      * present in the target world's own ``.BEF`` and confirmed native by
        ``catalog.is_native`` (a blob merely present is not proof of nativity);
      * in ``WALKING_MELEE_POOL`` -- we want a walker's locomotion set;
      * its material section walks (otherwise nothing about it is trustworthy);
      * it has at least one LOCAL CATEGORY-1 ref, so a bone count is measurable,
        and at least one LOCAL CATEGORY-2 ref, so there is something to borrow.
        A native whose refs are all GLOBAL (GRAVE's Basic_Skeleton, SwordSkeleton,
        Guard_Skeleton, Basic_Zombie) is unusable as a donor here: its animation
        lives in ``GLOBAL.PRS``, not in this world's anim table, so its indices
        would resolve against the wrong file.

    Bone count of a candidate is the MAXIMUM across its local cat-1 meshes: an
    enemy commonly names one skinned skeleton plus 0-bone props, and the
    skeleton is what an animation drives.

    Returns an ``AnimDonor`` or ``None`` when no native qualifies.

        enemy names more anims than the donor owns (Dark_Knight names 11, Ghost
        owns 3) the surplus all land on the donor's LAST index -- every
        reference then resolves to a real, skeleton-driving entry, which is the
        whole point; picking a wrong-but-valid clip is acceptable, leaving a
        source-world index that binds nothing is not.

        Raises ``_PortRefusal`` if a substituted index is not < the target's
        anim count, so the caller refuses the enemy and mutates nothing.

        sit in the target archive -- via
        ``mesh_port.mesh_entry_anim_target_names``.

        BOTH NAMESPACES, because an anim record may address either: an SKA

        anim[46], Dark_Knight's head/effect clip, addresses ``helmet``, ``nail``,

        none of them a bone of his skeleton mesh[25]). Checking a MEA record
        against bone names alone would refuse a record that binds perfectly.

        THIS IS THE NON-VACUOUS FORM OF THE CHECK. Task 9.3's end-to-end test
        derived the target names from the anim bundle itself, which makes
        ``can_bind_to_rig`` true by construction and therefore proves nothing.
        The names here come from the MESH, an independent artefact parsed by an
        independent parser (``prs_mesh_parser.load_bone``), so a record whose
        channels name bones the rig does not carry is genuinely caught.

        Union across every entry the enemy ported: an enemy names one skinned
        skeleton plus 0-bone props, and only the skeleton contributes names.
        An entry whose bone names cannot be read contributes nothing and is
        logged; if NOTHING can be read the caller gets an empty tuple and the

    This function contains no porting logic at all: it hand-builds a
    ``PlacementPlan(path=PORT)`` and hands it to ``companion_port.port_group``,
    which calls ``session.port_enemy`` unchanged -- exactly what
    ``_run_companion_experiment`` above and
    ``research/tools/measure_structure_route_costs.py`` already do, and exactly
    what Task 1 measured to be entity-generic: nothing on the ``port_enemy`` /
    ``_port_enemy`` path inspects what KIND of entity it is handling, and
    ``enemy_id`` is a name plus the BEF type id to inject under, never a
    discriminator. The source mesh-table walk, the target mesh trust gate, the
    anim trust gate and rig bind check, the texture remap, the
    ``missed_local_refs`` recovery and the append-only BEF injection all run
    UNMODIFIED. No gate is relaxed and no gate is duplicated.

    ``classify_placement`` is deliberately NOT called: its step 1 refuses
    anything outside ``WALKING_MELEE_POOL``, so every structure classifies
    ``REFUSE_NOT_MELEE`` there. That function is a separate static classifier the
    port path neither calls nor needs (Task 1's finding), and bypassing it is not
    bypassing a trust gate -- the enemy-pool test simply does not describe an
    entity the enemy placer never places.

    ``companions`` is the MEASURED closure from the route's cost row, passed
    straight through. ``port_group`` re-resolves the closure from the source
    bytecode and REFUSES if the two disagree, so a stale row cannot port.

    A refusal REFUSES THIS ROUTE ONLY and mutates nothing (Req 1.5):
    ``port_group`` snapshots the session and restores it before recording exactly
    one refusal, so the target world's buffers equal what they would have been
    had the route not been attempted.

    Runs BOTH admission phases per target world through `unified_admit`, over the
    REAL gated port path, and returns
    ``({filename: bytes}, {world: UnifiedResult})`` -- one record per target
    world, and the merged buffers in exactly the shape `iso_patcher` consumes.

    WHAT MAKES THIS THE REAL PASS RATHER THAN TASK 3'S DRY ONE:

      * the live size read is the SESSION's, `len(session.prs) + len(session.prt)`,
        so the budget bound is measured on committed bytes rather than predicted;
      * `port_fn` is the ACTUAL gated port path -- `session.port_enemy` (or
        `_port_group_with_companions` when `COMPANION_PORT_ENABLED`) for an enemy
        route and `port_structure_route` for a structure route. Every trust gate,
        the texture remap, the anim trust gate, the rig bind check and
        `verify_session` are untouched and undurplicated; a gate refusal becomes a
        `refused_gate` row and mutates nothing.

    ONE `WorldPortSession` per world, walked in sorted order, so the
    one-`.PRS`-resident rule holds and two routes into the same world share one
    set of buffers. A source `.BEF` is parsed per route and dropped immediately,
    keeping at most four binaries live per world.

    The two switches stay INDEPENDENT: `enemies_enabled` and
    `structures_enabled` are applied through `_PhaseMask`, and
    `structures_enabled` is additionally what `unified_admit` uses to decide
    whether phase 2 runs at all and how the `STRUCTURE_RESERVE_BYTES` slice is
    carved. A structures-only run therefore opens sessions and commits normally.

    """Classify, port and batch every candidate placement of a run.

    ``placements`` is an iterable of ``(enemy_id, target_world, blob)`` triples:

      * ``enemy_id``     -- ``int`` enemy type id (the BEF entry's type id).
      * ``target_world`` -- lowercase world name as used by ``catalog``
                            (``"grave"``, ``"castle"``, ...). The uppercase
                            filename stem is derived from it.
      * ``blob``         -- the enemy's BEF blob bytes, taken from the SOURCE
                            world's ``.BEF``. Its mesh-index field is rewritten
                            during porting; the input bytes are never mutated.

    ONE ``WorldPortSession`` is created per target world that has at least one
    ``PORT`` placement OR is named in ``structure_worlds``, so two enemies
    going into GRAVE share one set of buffers and both survive into the output.

    KILL SWITCH: with ``MESH_PORT_ENABLED`` False this ALWAYS returns ``{}``.
    Plans are still classified and sessions are still opened (read-only) so the
    log names every route that would have been ported, but ``port_enemy``
    refuses each one before mutating anything, so every session's ``finish()``
    reports no changes and ``iso_patcher`` receives nothing to write.

    Returns ``{filename: bytes}`` merged across every world's ``finish()`` --
    exactly the shape ``iso_patcher`` consumes. Returns ``{}`` when
    ``cross_world`` is off or when nothing needed porting -- where "nothing"
    means no ``PORT`` placement AND no ``structure_worlds`` entry. ``GLOBAL.PRT`` is
    NOT consulted: texture ids in render passes are world-local, so its
    presence or absence cannot affect a port.

    ``sessions_out``, if given, is a dict that receives ``{target_world:
    WorldPortSession}`` so a caller (notably ``verify_session``) can inspect
    the in-memory buffers afterwards. Nothing here writes to disk.

    ``admit_fn``, if given, is called as ``admit_fn(plan, session)`` IMMEDIATELY
    BEFORE each group is ported, and a falsy return (or a ``(False, reason)``
    pair) SKIPS that group -- nothing is ported for it and no buffer is touched.
    It exists for ONE reason: the seeded selector's budget bound is enforced
    against the LIVE ``len(session.prs) + len(session.prt)``, and that number
    only exists in here, between two group commits. Defaults to ``None``, in
    which case this function behaves exactly as it did before the parameter
    existed -- existing callers are unaffected.

    ``admit_fn`` is a REFUSAL PATH, never a permission path: it can only ever
    stop a placement ``classify_placement`` and ``allowlist_lookup`` already
    permitted. The permission model is untouched.

    ``structure_fn``, if given, is called ONCE PER WORLD as
    ``structure_fn(session)`` after every enemy group for that world has been
    attempted and BEFORE ``session.finish()``. That position is the whole of
    Requirement 5.2 of `cross-world-structures`: the enemies are already
    admitted and committed, so the live ``len(prs) + len(prt)`` the structure
    pass reads is what the enemy pass LEFT, and a structure can only ever spend
    the remainder. It shares the session, so the one-``.PRS``-resident rule
    holds (Req 5.5).
    Defaults to ``None``, in which case this function behaves exactly as it did
    before the parameter existed.

    ``structure_worlds`` names worlds that need a session even though they have
    NO enemy placement at all. It exists because the two cross-world features
    are INDEPENDENT switches: with cross-world ENEMIES off and cross-world
    STRUCTURES on the caller passes ``placements=[]``, ``admit_fn=None`` and
    ``structure_worlds=(...)``, and each named world still gets its own session
    and its own ``structure_fn(session)`` pass. The set of sessions is the UNION
    of the enemy-target worlds and ``structure_worlds``, walked in sorted order,
    so a world with enemy placements behaves exactly as it always did --
    including the ordering rule above, structures last. ``structure_worlds`` is
    only consulted when ``structure_fn`` is given. It defaults to ``()``, in
    which case this function behaves exactly as it did before the parameter
    existed: an empty ``to_port`` still returns ``{}`` and opens nothing.
