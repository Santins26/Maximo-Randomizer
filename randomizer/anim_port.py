"""Anim-table walker for world ``.PRS`` archives (task 5).

Mirrors ``mesh_port.py`` in shape and naming, and reuses its anchor helpers
rather than re-deriving them: ``find_anim_table_anchor``, ``read_anim_count``
and ``ANIM_RECORD_SIGNATURE`` all come from there. ``find_anim_table_anchor`` is
the END OF THE MESH TABLE (corroborated by the type-id word), not a ``TFA\xff``
scan -- ``TFA\xff`` is MEA magic and an SKA-first table has none.

THIS TASK (5.1) IS REGION LOCATION ONLY. What lands later:

* ``record_length`` -- the per-TYPE-TAG advance rules from the ELF: task 5.4.
* ``walk_anim_table`` / ``find_record_bounds`` / ``extract_record_from_buffer``:
  task 5.5.
* ``round_trip_record``: task 6.1.
* ``assess_anim_table`` / ``assess_source_record`` (the trust gate): task 6.3,
  landed. It passes for ALL FIVE worlds, where ``mesh_port``'s
  ``assess_target_table`` passes for GRAVE alone -- which is precisely why anim
  porting is viable into worlds mesh porting cannot target.
* ``append_anim_records`` and everything about porting: tasks 8-9. That is the
  consumer of ``AnimRegion.trailer`` -- see below.

Layout, as MEASURED and VALIDATED against all five worlds in task 3.3
(``.kiro/specs/anim-table-format/elf-notes.md`` is authoritative):

    anchor + 0   u32   2            -- THIS table's resource type id
    anchor + 4   u32   record count -- read by mesh_port.read_anim_count
    anchor + 8   u32   TYPE TAG of the FIRST RECORD

So **records start at anchor + 8**, not anchor + 12. The word at ``anchor + 8``
is the first record's tag, which the engine's own loader reads inside its
per-record loop (``LoadAnimResTable`` `0x00167FE4`), NOT a header constant.
``AnimRegion`` therefore reports it as ``first_tag`` and this module never
requires it to be ``0x0A`` (Requirement 1.4). It is ``0x0A`` (MEA) in the five
main worlds and ``0x0C`` (SKA) in all six ARENA archives, which is exactly why
neither this module nor ``mesh_port.read_anim_count`` may demand ``0x0A``.

The record region ends at ``len(data) - 16``. The final 16 bytes are a uniform
archive TRAILER, byte-identical in all five worlds::

    03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

``AnimRegion`` exposes it verbatim because task 9's ``append_anim_records`` has
to reproduce it after the appended records (Requirement 8.4).

    UNDER   3,641,513  2,516,188     90      2,516,196    3,641,497

UNDER declares **90**, not the 89 recorded elsewhere in the project: the file
says 90 and 90 records walk cleanly to the trailer, while 89 would leave a whole
20,656-byte record unconsumed.

No function here scans for markers or resyncs. A signature scan is exactly what
failed before (57% of records carry no magic), so every failure is a signal --
``AnimParseError`` or ``None`` -- never a guess.

       what makes an SKA-first table (all six arena archives) locate correctly;
       the old ``TFA\\xff``-only anchor put the "region" 160-621 KB INSIDE such a
       table and reported a truncated count.
    2. the ``TFA\\xff`` scan, and ONLY when (1) found nothing. For a real archive
       that cannot happen -- a ``.PRS`` always has a walkable mesh table at 0x20
       with the type-id word after it. What reaches the fallback is an ANIM TABLE
       HELD ON ITS OWN, with no mesh table in front of it: the synthetic buffers
       that exercise this module's walker and gate directly. Those are MEA-first
       by construction, so the scan is exact for them.

    The fallback cannot reintroduce the SKA bug it replaced, because an arena
    archive has a walkable mesh table and so never reaches it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Task 6.3 -- the trust gate.
#
# `assess_anim_table` is the anim-side twin of `mesh_port.assess_target_table`,
# down to the verdict shape (`ok` / `reasons` / `details` / `reason`), because
# `cross_world.refuse` already consumes that pattern.
#
# THE CONTRAST WITH THE MESH GATE IS THE POINT OF THIS FEATURE. Today
# `assess_target_table` passes for GRAVE ALONE: ICE resyncs inside entry 16, and
# CASTLE / SWAMP / UNDER walk 277,952 / 170,328 / 737,676 bytes short of their
# anim anchors. `assess_anim_table` passes for ALL FIVE WORLDS -- the walk
# reproduces every declared count exactly and lands on the archive trailer with
# zero trailing bytes in each. That is why anim porting is viable into worlds
# that mesh porting cannot target at all.
#
# Five conditions, each producing its OWN reason string so a caller can see
# every reason a table was rejected rather than just the first:
#
#   1. the walked record count equals the declared count;
#   2. the bounds tile the region -- first bound at `records_start`, each
#      subsequent bound starting exactly where its predecessor ended;
#   3. no walk event was raised (nothing was guessed);
#   4. every record round-trips byte-identically (Requirement 4.2);
#   5. SIGNATURE CORROBORATION -- see below.
#
# Condition 5 exists because conditions 1-4 all run through `record_length`. A
# gate built only from them asks the parser to confirm itself, which proves
# nothing about whether the parser is right. So the gate also SCANS the region
# for every `TFA\xff` occurrence -- a completely different method from a chain
# walk -- and requires that
#
#   * each occurrence lands exactly 4 bytes into a walked tag-0x0A record, i.e.
#     at `record_start + 4` where the MEA loader reads its magic, and
#   * the number of occurrences equals the number of tag-0x0A records.
#
# Agreement between a scan and a chain walk is independent evidence; the walk
# agreeing with itself is not. Task 3.3 measured this exactly -- GRAVE 23/23,
# CASTLE 38/38, SWAMP 23/23, ICE 34/34, UNDER 28/28, with no stray signature
# inside any payload -- so the check is calibrated against real bytes, and it is
# what catches a rule set that lands on the right COUNT by accident while
# sliding record boundaries across each other.
#
# `walk.trailing` is REPORTED in `details`, never required to be zero. It is
# zero in all five shipped worlds; the gate states the fact instead of assuming
# it, and task 9's append path preserves whatever is actually there.
#
# Nothing here raises for malformed data. A failed assessment is a verdict with
# `ok=False`, mirroring the walker's contract, so `cross_world` can turn it
# straight into a refusal.

#
#   * the BEF CATEGORY-2 ref ORDER is a stable authored per-enemy SLOT LIST, but

#     resource loader), no per-enemy anim-slot table in ``.rodata`` and no
#     animation-role string anywhere;
#   * the record bytes name BONES and MESH NODES, never clips.
#
# Consequence, stated plainly so nothing downstream mistakes this code for a
# working role resolver: ``resolve_roles`` returns ``ClipRole.UNKNOWN`` for
# EVERY ref of EVERY real enemy, and ``map_by_role`` therefore degrades to its
# positional fallback in every real case. The role machinery is implemented in
# full anyway so that a future role source (the lead in role-notes.md is the
# compiled script bytecode in the level `.PSX` files, unexamined and unproven)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Task 8.4 -- Rig_Binding: does a record NAME its bones or INDEX them?
#
# VERDICT: BY_NAME. Measured, not assumed. The evidence, in the order it
# actually decides the question (full write-up in role-notes.md):
#
#   1. Every `ska_node` opens with a 32-byte NUL-padded NAME (`_ska_node`,
#      transcribed from PSkeletonAnim::Load 0x0016B8B0). The shipped values are
#      real rig identifiers and each enemy has its own convention:
#        Axe_Skeleton 0x2F  hip, l_thigh, l_shin, l_foot
#        Ghost        0x6B  hip, waist, neck, hair1#2
#        Raven        0x37  hips, lthigh, lshin, lfoot
#        Torso_Zombie 0x6A  HIPtop, WAIST, HEAD, JAWLOW
#      The engine's own local for the MEA equivalent is `aszAnimTreeMeshNodeName`
#      -- the executable calls that field a NAME.
#   2. Nothing in either loader indexes a bone array by a small integer taken
#      from the record, and there is no bone-index bounds check anywhere in
#      PSkeletonAnim::Load or ska_node. An index space the engine never bounds
#      is an index space the engine does not have.
#   3. The named discriminator, run rather than argued: the SKA per-record node
#      count `B` does NOT track the enemy's measured MESH bone count. Across the
#      GRAVE pool a record animates a SUBSET (0x2F: B = 22..39 against a 39-bone
#      mesh; 0x6A: B = 18..20 against 28; 0x37: B = 21..23 against 31; 0x6B:
#      B = 22..24 against 36), and B VARIES BETWEEN RECORDS OF THE SAME ENEMY.
#      A dense bone-index space would give one fixed B equal to (or bounding)
#      the bone count. A per-record subset selected by name is exactly what is
#      observed. `rig_binding_evidence` computes this per record so a caller can
#      re-check it instead of trusting this comment.
#   3b. The other half of the named discriminator -- the small-integer header
#      fields -- fails it in the opposite direction: an `ska_node` header's
#      count words reach 41 on Axe_Skeleton, which has 39 bones, so they do not
#      even FIT the index space they would have to index. They track the clip's
#      key/frame count, not the rig.
#   4. The only small integers in a channel header are the MEA `KIND` (1..4) and
#      `MODE` (1..2), which the ELF string pool names ANIM_TRANSLATE /
#      ANIM_ROTATE / ANIM_SCALE / ANIM_MISC and ANIM_EVAL_LINEAR /
#      ANIM_EVAL_SPLINE. Channel TYPE and interpolation mode, not bone indices,
#      and neither reaches 28 let alone 39.
#
# CONSEQUENCE (Requirement 7.4/7.6, recorded in role-notes.md): a Bone_Remap --
# a source-index -> target-index table -- is UNNECESSARY, because there are no
# indices to remap, and it would be IMPOSSIBLE to make a difference anyway: the
# binding key is the name string, so a record binds to a target rig if and only
# if the target rig carries every name the record addresses. `missing_bone_names`
# is that predicate; task 9.3 owns the refusal it feeds.
#
# `BY_INDEX` stays implemented and reachable (see `_index_evidence`) because
# Requirement 7.1 asks the question per record, and a record that answered it
# the other way must not be silently read as BY_NAME. No shipped record does.
# `UNDETERMINED` is returned whenever neither structure is present -- never a
# guess (Requirement 7.3, 7.5).

        Empty otherwise.
    node_count:
        ``B`` for SKA, ``N`` for MEA -- how many nodes this ONE record animates.
    bone_count:
        The rig's measured bone count, when the caller supplied one
        (``mesh_port.mesh_entry_signature(prs, mesh_index)[2]``). ``None`` when
        it was not supplied; the verdict does not depend on it.
    highest_index:
        Requirement 7.2: the highest bone index the record addresses, ``None``
        unless ``binding`` is ``BY_INDEX``.
    index_in_range:
        Requirement 7.2's comparison: whether ``highest_index < bone_count``.
        ``None`` when either value is unavailable.
    tracks_bone_count:
        The task's named discriminator. True when ``node_count == bone_count``,
        i.e. when this record's node loop covers the rig exactly -- the shape a
        dense index space would have. False when the record animates a SUBSET.
        ``None`` without a ``bone_count``.
    small_int_max:
        The largest small integer (< 256) in the record's node / channel
        headers. A bone index would stay below ``bone_count`` and would GROW
        with the rig. Measured, it does neither: Axe_Skeleton reaches 41 against
        a 39-bone rig, i.e. it EXCEEDS the index space it would have to fit in.
        These words are key counts (they track the clip's frame count ``A``),
        not bone indices.

# Task 9.3 -- `port_anim_records`: port an enemy's OWN anim records.
#
# WHAT THIS FIXES, and why it is the function the whole spec was aimed at.
#
# The shipped cross-world feature cannot port anim records, so it SUBSTITUTES:
# a ported enemy's LOCAL CATEGORY-2 refs are repointed at a target-world
# NATIVE's anim indices (`cross_world.select_anim_donor` /
# `_substitute_anim_refs`, behind `ANIM_SUBSTITUTION_ENABLED`). Task 8.4 proved
# SKA records address bones BY NAME, and the four GRAVE donor enemies use four
# MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE bone naming conventions -- Torso_Zombie's `HIPtop` /
# `WAIST` shares not one name with Axe_Skeleton's `hip` / `l_thigh`. Matching is
# an exact string compare, so a BORROWED clip can never bind correctly. That is
# the measured explanation for the user's report that limbs move but the
# animation is wrong, and it is a HARD CEILING on the heuristic: no donor choice
# removes it, because the defect is not donor selection.
#
# Porting the enemy's OWN records carries its OWN bone names, so every channel
# resolves BY CONSTRUCTION. That is what this function does.
#
# THE CONSEQUENCE OF BY_NAME BINDING, and the reason for the Requirement 7.6
# refusal: a ported record NAMES bones that must exist in the rig it drives.
# When the enemy's own MESH is ported alongside it (which
# `cross_world._port_enemy` already does), the rig comes with it and the names
# match. So `target_bone_names` is the bone-name list of THE RIG THE RECORD WILL
# DRIVE -- the ported mesh's own bones -- NOT some target-world native's. A
# source bone with no counterpart there is a REFUSAL. Nothing is ever remapped
# and nothing is ever partially bound: `can_bind_to_rig` is the predicate and it
# refuses `UNDETERMINED` outright too (Requirement 7.5).
#
# ORDER OF OPERATIONS, exactly the design's, all on STAGED copies that the
# caller adopts only on FULL success:
#
#   1. gate the TARGET anim table (`assess_anim_table`); refuse if it fails;
#   2. per source record, `assess_source_record`; refuse if any fails;
#   3. rig classification + bone-name compatibility; refuse per above;
#   4. DEDUPE through the memo, mirroring `cross_world.mesh_memo`: a record
#      wanted by several refs, or by several enemies in one session, is appended
#      ONCE and every ref points at the one new index (Requirement 8.8);
#   5. `append_anim_records` on the staged buffer;
#   6. rewrite the enemy's LOCAL CATEGORY-2 refs with
#      `bef.set_material_ref_index`, PRESERVING THE FLAG BYTE. The flag carries
#      the category and the global bit, so a changed flag repoints the ref at a
#      different resource table entirely. GLOBAL refs are NEVER touched;
#   7. bounds-check every rewritten index against the NEW count (Req 8.6);
#   8. post-append re-walk: `assess_anim_table` on the staged result must pass
#      AND the walk must be clean with `trailing == 0` (Requirement 8.9);
#   9. only then does the caller adopt the staged buffer.
#
# REFUSAL SHAPE: this function NEVER raises for a recoverable condition. It
# returns an `AnimPortOutcome` whose `ok` is False and whose `reason` reads the
# way `mesh_port`'s verdicts do, because `cross_world.refuse(plan, reason,
# details)` already consumes exactly that -- the design's "cross_world converts
# a failed verdict into session.refuse(...)". The `_PortRefusal` route was the
# alternative; a verdict object was chosen so `anim_port` keeps its module-wide
# rule that no public function raises for malformed data, and so the caller does
# not have to catch across a staged-buffer boundary.
#
# ALL-OR-NOTHING: a refusal at ANY step mutates nothing. Nothing here writes
# through to the caller -- not the buffer, not the blob, not the memo. On a
# refusal `prs` and `blob` are None and the caller keeps its own bytes, which
# are therefore byte-identical.
#
# THE TWO HAZARDS the design calls out (task 9.5 owns their fixes; this function
# is written so as not to CREATE them):
#
#   * `WorldPortSession.target_anim_count` is cached and reads the PRISTINE
#     buffer, so it goes STALE the moment an append lands. This function never
#     consults it: every bound it checks comes from the count in the buffer it
#     was handed, and `new_count` is REPORTED so the caller can refresh.
#   * appending MESH entries SHIFTS the anim anchor (`find_anim_table_anchor` is
#     derived from the first `TFA\xff` offset, which sits after the mesh table).
#     So this function re-locates the region from the buffer it is ACTUALLY
#     HANDED, on every call, and caches no anchor across a mutation.
#
# ORDERING within a combined mesh+anim port -- mesh entries inserted first, the
# anim region re-located from the staged buffer afterwards -- is TASK 9.5's
# BUSINESS, not this function's. This function is correct for whatever buffer it
# is given; it does not decide when it is given it.
#
# This function is NOT wired into `WorldPortSession` and changes no live
# behaviour. The routing decision and `ANIM_PORT_ENABLED` are task 10.1.

    Attributes
    ----------
    prs / blob:
        The STAGED buffer and STAGED blob, to be adopted by the caller ONLY when
        ``ok``. ``None`` on a refusal, so a caller cannot mistake a refusal for a
        rewrite and its own bytes stay byte-identical.
    new_indices:
        ``(source_world, source_index) -> target anim index``, covering both the
        records appended by this call and the ones the memo already had.
    appended:
        The source indices actually appended, in append order. Its length is the
        count delta, so a record wanted by several refs appears ONCE
        (Requirement 8.8).
    rewrites:
        ``blob idx_offset -> (flag, new_index)`` for every rewritten LOCAL
        CATEGORY-2 ref. The flag is the byte read back OUT of the staged blob,
        so it is evidence the flag survived rather than a restatement of intent.
    memo:
        The staged memo -- the caller's memo plus this port's additions. Adopt it
        only alongside ``prs`` and ``blob``, or a later enemy will be pointed at
        an index that was never committed.
    old_count / new_count:
        The target table's declared count before and after. ``new_count`` is what
        every rewritten index was bounds-checked against (Requirement 8.6) and
        what a caller caching an anim count must refresh to (the stale-cache
        hazard, task 9.5).
    trailer_offset:
        Where the preserved 16-byte trailer now sits (Requirement 8.4).

    """Port an enemy's OWN anim records into ``target_data``. Never raises.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_data:
        The target world's ``.PRS`` bytes AS THEY ARE NOW -- the staged buffer
        mid-port, not a pristine copy. The anim region is RE-LOCATED from this
        buffer on every call, so a mesh insert that shifted the anchor is
        accounted for automatically and no anchor is ever cached across a
        mutation. WHEN this is called relative to a mesh insert is task 9.5's
        ordering rule, not this function's business.
    blob:
        The enemy's ``.BEF`` blob, already carrying whatever CATEGORY-1 rewrites
        the mesh port made.
    refs:
        The blob's material refs as ``bef.parse_material_refs`` returned them
        FOR THIS BLOB. Only LOCAL CATEGORY-2 refs are touched; GLOBAL refs are
        never touched, and neither is anything in another category.
    source:
        An :class:`AnimSourceBundle` from :func:`collect_source_records` (the
        memory-disciplined form -- the source ``.PRS`` is already dropped), or a
        raw source ``.PRS`` buffer, in which case ``source_world`` is required
        and the records are gated here (both buffers resident, the design's
        literal ``port_anim_records(target_data, source_data, indices)`` shape).
    target_bone_names:
        The bone names of THE RIG THE RECORDS WILL DRIVE -- the ported enemy's
        own mesh, ported alongside. NOT a target-world native's rig: a native's
        names are a different convention and every channel would fail to bind,
        which is the very defect this function exists to remove.
    memo:
        The session dedupe memo, keyed ``(source_world, 2, source_index)`` like
        ``cross_world.mesh_memo``. READ, never written: the staged memo comes
        back in ``outcome.memo`` for the caller to adopt on success.

    Returns an :class:`AnimPortOutcome`. On a refusal it carries the reason and
    NOTHING ELSE -- the caller's buffer, blob and memo are untouched, so a
    refused port leaves them byte-identical (Requirement 8.7).
