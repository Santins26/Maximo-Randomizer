"""
Universal item randomizer for Maximo: Ghosts to Glory.

Every item-class entity in a level rolls independently into a different type
from the universal pool. Enemies are a one-way destination — they can be
rolled INTO from items, but enemy-to-enemy swaps are handled by the dedicated
walking-melee randomizer in cli.py.

Size constraints are budget-tracked so the file never grows past its original
size. Trigger-volume properties are translated when entities move so detection
ranges work at the new world position. Skeleton keys placed at random
positions get their 'collectable' flags forced on.

See randomize_universal() for the main pipeline and aggressive_item_randomize()
for the multi-pass entry point used by the CLI.

# Gold_Key entity (type 0x2B). Used in C_INTRO/C_SUB2 (Castle), G_SUB1 (Grave),

# records — the engine activates them at runtime when the player clears the
# kill-group of records sharing the same instance_name (a mix of enemies,
# bags, pickups, etc). We protect ALL Gold_Key entities by type so they can't
# be turned into other things AND so they aren't placed at random positions
# where the player can't reach them. Additionally, every record SHARING a

GOLD_KEY_TYPE = 0x2B

# Types that ANCHOR a kill-group / progression trigger. Any record sharing an
# instance_name with one of these is protected from randomization.
#
# Discovered the hard way: there's a kill-group called 'end1' in EVERY world
# that contains 30+ siblings (Locked_Chests, Skeleton_Keys, Gold_Keys,
# enemies, smashables) and gates the level finisher. Randomizing any enemy
# inside that group breaks the death-count and the player can't finish.
# Same for kill-groups that hold a Level_Column (HUB level-select), or a
# Skeleton_Key (which the engine spawns when its kill-group is cleared).
#
#   0x2B Gold_Key       — boss-key drop, gates locked gates
#   0x59 Level_Column   — HUB level-select tile
#   0x65 Skeleton_Key   — small-key drop (locked chests, doors)
#   0x5F Monster_Generator — wave spawner; see bug note below
#
# NOT in this list:
#   0x25 Wooden_Chest, 0x5B Locked_Chest — these were originally treated as
#     anchors but doing so over-protected ~85% of all chests (every chest
#     with a non-auto-generated name like 'deadend1' / 'mimic' / 'first'
#     became kill-group-locked and never rolled). The engine binds chest
#     content gating via PROTECTED_TAGS and PROTECTED_INSTANCE_NAMES which
#     already cover the actual progression-critical chests (key1, gate1,
#     and chests carrying tag (31,2) or (34,1)). Plus the 'end1' group is
#     anchored by the Skeleton_Key it contains, so removing chest-anchors
#     doesn't compromise level-finisher protection.
#
# BUG FIX (investigated after reports of infinite loading on Dead Heat /
# Quick and the Dead / Crushed Spirits): Monster_Generator was previously
# NOT an anchor type, and was explicitly allowed as a randomization SOURCE
# (see its entry in HAZARD_PROTECTED_AS_SOURCE's sibling list) on the
# reasoning that losing a wave-spawner is only cosmetically worse (fewer
# enemies), never a break. That reasoning misses named kill-groups where
# the Monster_Generator IS the group's anchor member and something else in
# the same group is progression-critical. Confirmed case: G_SUB1.PSX (Dead
# Heat) has a 10-member 'crypt1' group containing a Locked_Chest (0x5B) and
# a Monster_Generator (0x5F) among ordinary enemies -- with no member of
# type Gold_Key/Level_Column/Skeleton_Key, this group was previously
# entirely unprotected, and its Monster_Generator was being randomized away
# (e.g. into a Wooden_Chest) by the base randomizer. Adding Monster_Generator
# as an anchor type protects every group like this by NAME (once any member
# is anchor-typed, the whole named group is protected -- see the loop
# below), without reopening the ~85%-of-chests over-protection problem
# Locked_Chest caused: Monster_Generator only appears 0-2 times per file, so
# this adds a small, precise set of named groups rather than a blanket rule.

def get_progression_protected_names(psx) -> set[str]:
    """Per-file protection set: every instance_name shared with a
    progression-critical anchor record (Gold_Key / Level_Column /
    Skeleton_Key), PLUS every instance_name matching the level-finisher
    naming convention ('end1', 'end2', 'end3', ...).

    Why: The engine uses kill-group bookkeeping based on shared
    instance_name to spawn keys, open gates, and trigger level-finishers.
    Vanilla observation: a kill-group named 'end1' exists in every world
    and contains the level-end Skeleton_Keys, Locked_Chests, and 30+
    enemies. Randomizing any sibling inside that group means the engine
    never sees the death-count threshold cross and the player can't finish
    the level.

    BUG FOUND (investigated after reports of infinite loading on Dead Heat /
    Quick and the Dead / Crushed Spirits with plain item/enemy randomization
    -- no level-shuffle options enabled): the type-based scan below assumes
    every progression-critical kill-group contains at least one
    PROGRESSION_ANCHOR_TYPES member (Gold_Key/Level_Column/Skeleton_Key).
    That assumption is FALSE for many levels -- a survey of the vanilla PSX
    files found 'end1'/'end2'/'end3' groups made up entirely of ordinary
    enemies (Basic_Skeleton, Axe_Skeleton, Goat_Devil, ...), a Wooden_Chest,
    a CamTrigger, etc, with NO anchor-typed member at all in G_SUB1.PSX,
    S_SUB3.PSX, and U_SUB1.PSX specifically (and likely others). In those
    files this function previously returned an empty protection set for the
    'end*' group, so the base randomizer was free to re-roll every enemy in
    the level-finisher kill-group -- when the finisher enemy got replaced,
    the engine's death-count threshold is never crossed and the level hangs
    on load. The name-pattern check below closes that gap directly, since
    'end<N>' is the one naming convention confirmed (by the comment above,
    predating this fix) to always mean level-finisher.

    Empty/blank instance_names (which most non-anchor enemies use) are NOT

    World-specific tier ranges keep us from rolling tiers the BEF didn't
    load — e.g. Basic_Zombie tier 2 only loads in SWAMP / UNDER, so applying
    it in GRAVE produces a non-functional zombie.

    Tier weighting: by default uses ENEMY_TIER_WEIGHTS_PER_TYPE (biases e.g.
    Basic_Zombie toward tier 2). A `tier_weights_per_type` override
    {type_id: {tier: weight}} (from the editable spawn config) takes
    precedence — letting the user set the % of each enemy class level. Tiers
    outside the world's valid pool are ignored; if every valid tier is
    weighted 0 the record's tier is left unchanged.

# Some enemies carry a bool prop that flips a visual sub-type the engine
# renders differently. Verified by cross-referencing vanilla per-world data
# with in-game observations:
#
#   Ghost (0x6B), prop[0] type=0x01 bool:
#       Castle uses val=1, every other world uses val=0. Likely flips
#       between two visual sub-types ("Poltergeist" white floater vs the
#       Castle's blue ghost variant). Re-rolling per-record on a vanilla-
#       weighted distribution gives every world a small chance of either.
#
# REMOVED FLAGS (do not appear to do what we thought):
#
#   Basic_Zombie (0x48), prop[6]: original hypothesis was "splittable into
#       Torso_Zombie". Verified WRONG. The 2 vanilla Basic_Zombies that
#       actually have a paired Torso_Zombie (sharing instance_name) both
#       have prop[6]=0. Splitting is triggered by the engine spawning a
#       Torso_Zombie record bound to the same instance_name, not by a
#       per-record bool. Setting prop[6] to 0 or 1 changes nothing visible
#       in-game, so we no longer touch it.
#
#   Basic_Skeleton (0x47), prop[6]: same story — no observable effect tied
#       to it. Likely an unused / reserved slot.

    Why this exists: cli.py picks ONE template per (world, type) when
    swapping enemies. Every Ghost in Grave inherits the Grave template's
    bool (=0 Poltergeist) and every Ghost in Castle inherits the Castle

# EXPERIMENTAL: boss duplication.
#
# Boss arenas are normally skipped entirely. As an opt-in experiment we can
# clone the arena's single boss instance into a redundant slot so the fight
# has TWO bosses. This is byte-budget-safe: we overwrite a non-essential slot
# (e.g. one of the decorative arena lights, which is LARGER than the boss
# record) with the boss clone, so the file never grows.
#
# Only Grave is wired up. Its GraveDigger (type 0x29) sits alone in
# G_BOSS.PSX alongside 8 Entity_Light (0x6D) records — overwriting a side
# light with a second GraveDigger keeps the file size valid. We mirror the
# clone's position across the arena center so the two bosses don't overlap.
#
# NOTE: this is genuinely experimental. The boss death event / Boss_Camera
# are scripted around a single boss, so a second instance may not initialize
# cleanly, may break the victory trigger, or may behave oddly. It will not
# touch the main randomization — it only runs for the listed boss files when
# the caller explicitly enables it.

        kept on, with its INTENSITY randomized per seed. These levels are

        present/absent with `present_probability`, seed-derived. So different
        dry levels get surprise weather on different seeds — that's the
        seed-to-seed variety.

    Details:
      - Rain (0xD0) / Snow (0xCF) emitters: trigger-driven levels keep the
        emitter and let randomized triggers drive intensity; others get a
        visible randomized density. Never muted.
      - Rain_Trigger (0xD7) / Snow_Trigger (0xD8) "on" zones (value > 0):
        intensity always re-randomized. "Off" zones (value 0) stay off so
        caves/interiors remain dry.
      - Fog density (idx=0) / blend (idx=7) always re-rolled across the vanilla
        range (fog is independent of the weather roll).
      - INJECTION: if `world` supports weather (grave/swamp = rain, ice = snow)
        and the injection roll is present but the level has NO emitter, a
        weather_template is cloned into a spare Fog_Volume slot.
