"""Companion-entity investigation and porting support.

Task 1.1 scope only: the CANDIDATE A probe of the companion investigation.

Candidate A asks a cheap question: is the object an enemy owns -- Bomb_Skeleton
``0x49``'s bomb, Dark_Knight ``0x53``'s purple wall -- a SEPARATE BEF entry with
its own type id? If it is, it must be a type id CASTLE declares and GRAVE does
not, because if GRAVE already declared the bomb the bomb would already appear.

CANDIDATE A ALONE GIVES A CANDIDATE SET, NOT AN EDGE. Knowing which type ids
exist in Castle and not in Grave does not prove that any of them is spawned by
``0x49`` or ``0x53``. The edge is what Task 1.3's blob scan tests for.

Everything here is READ-ONLY: it parses ``.BEF`` files (a few hundred KB each,
so several may be held at once) and writes nothing, anywhere. No ``.PRS`` is
opened by this module at all.

This module deliberately does NOT import ``cross_world``: the port session is
passed in by the caller so the dependency stays acyclic.

    """LOCAL cat-1/cat-2 resource refs that ``bef.parse_material_refs`` misses.

    THE GAP, MEASURED. ``parse_material_refs`` reads refs only from the START of
    each record body -- it walks ``while blob[p] in MATERIAL_REC_TYPES`` from
    ``body`` and stops at the first byte that is not ``0x04``/``0x05``. Records
    whose body does NOT begin with a ref therefore contribute NOTHING, even
    though a ref sits deeper inside them encoded identically.

    Goat_Devil ``0x13`` (UNDER.BEF) is the case that exposed it: three cat-2 refs
    at ``0x12E`` (anim 78), ``0x162`` (anim 78) and ``0x1F8`` (anim 89) are
    invisible to the parser, so their indices were never remapped and in the
    target world they addressed whatever native animation happened to occupy 78
    and 89. That is the "his attack animation is wrong/missing" report.

    The signature is deliberately NARROW so this cannot invent refs:
    ``[0x04|0x05][index u16][0x00][flag]`` with the flag REQUIRED to correlate
    with the record type (``0x05``->1 mesh, ``0x04``->2 anim). Across UNDER, ICE
    and SWAMP it yields exactly FIVE extra refs in THREE entities -- UNDER 0x13
    (three), ICE 0x7C (one), SWAMP 0x0B (one) -- which is a parser gap, not a
    false-positive spray.

    `bef.parse_material_refs` is NOT changed. It is used by the item randomizer,
    `cross_world` and `boss_inject`, and `anim_port` carries positional
    assumptions keyed to its ordering. These refs are returned SEPARATELY and
    merged only where remapping happens.

# CANDIDATE C (task 1.5) -- is the edge in the LEVEL files rather than the BEF?
#
# Candidate A produced a candidate set and nothing more. Candidate B came back a
# rigorous NEGATIVE: the only real field found in an enemy's own blob was
# `blob+0x10` u32 = the entry's OWN type id (80/80 across CASTLE), which is a
# self id, not a spawn edge. So this probe is load-bearing: if it is also
# negative, the verdict is CANDIDATE_C-as-bytecode or UNRESOLVED, and tasks 3-9
# of this spec are the wrong next step -- which both the design and tasks.md say
# in as many words.
#
# What the probe asks: does any CASTLE `.PSX` record, or any 0x20-byte property
# entry inside one, hold the byte value 0x49 (or 0x53) TOGETHER WITH a second
# CASTLE BEF type id? A level-authored spawn parameter -- "this Bomb_Skeleton
# throws entity Y" -- would look exactly like that.
#
# MEASURED FACTS ABOUT `psx.py` THIS BUILDS ON (read from the source, not
# assumed):
#   * `PsxFile.parse(path)` takes a path (str or Path), reads the whole file and
#     returns records; there is no bytes-level entry point.
#   * A record is `raw` = [0x100 class-name buffer][0x100 instance-name buffer]
#     [0x28 entity header][prop_count * 0x20 property entries]. Name buffers are
#     ASCII + 0xCD padding, so they are TEXT and are excluded from every byte
#     scan here: a 0xCD or an ASCII byte that happens to equal a type id is not a
#     reference.
#   * Records DO carry a type id: `PsxRecord.type_id` = raw[0x204], i.e. the byte
#     at +0x04 of the entity header. `find_records_by_type` exists, so "is 0x49
#     placed in this map at all" is directly answerable.
#   * `prop_count` is raw[0x20C] u32 and `compute_record_size` = 0x228 +
#     count*0x20, but `_parse_records` RESYNCS to the next class buffer when the
#     formula lands wrong, so `len(raw)` can exceed the formula size. Entry
#     enumeration here is therefore clamped to what `raw` actually holds.
#   * CASTLE `.PSX` filenames: the design guessed C_HUB, C_INTRO, C_KING,
#     C_QUEEN, C_SUB1, C_SUB2. VERIFIED against game_files/ -- those six exist
#     and are the only `C_*.PSX` files. The guess was right; `castle_psx_paths`
#     globs rather than hardcodes so a wrong guess could not survive.

# ============================================================================
# VERDICT (task 1.6) -- collapse the three probes into exactly one outcome.
#
# THE SUBTLETY THE DESIGN'S SKETCH DOES NOT CAPTURE. The design writes
# `if b_hits: return "CANDIDATE_B"` over the RAW output of
# `scan_blob_for_type_ids`, and over the RAW co-reference list from
# `find_co_references`. Both of those raw lists are NON-EMPTY for the real game
# files, and both were shown by CONTROLS to be pure noise:
#
#   * Candidate B: 0x49's blob yields 754 u8 / 94 u16 / 7 u32 raw hits, but a
#     control enemy with NO known companion (0x54) yields 1152 / 91 / 8, and the
#     u8 counts fall BELOW uniform chance because 80 of 256 byte values are
#     CASTLE type ids. The only survivor of cross-checking was blob+0x10 u32 =
#     the entry's OWN type id (80/80) -- a SELF id, not a spawn edge.
#   * Candidate C: 74 raw co-references across the six CASTLE levels, but the
#     control enemy scores 46 and a byte value that is NOT a type id at all
#     (0x01) scores 1,224 -- an order of magnitude MORE. 63 of the 74 have the
#     root byte at offset >= 0x10, i.e. inside position-float mantissa.
#
# So feeding the raw lists in returns CANDIDATE_B, which would be FALSE. This
# function therefore takes EDGE-BEARING evidence only, and says so in its
# signature names and its docstring, so that nobody later wires the raw scans
# straight in. Filtering is the CALLER's job because only the caller knows the
# controls it ran.
# ============================================================================

#: The FIVE permitted verdicts. Requirement 1.6 wants exactly one of these.
#:
#: ``CANDIDATE_D_BYTECODE`` was ADDED after the fact, and the addition is not a
#: convenience. It means: THE EDGE WAS RECOVERED BY DECODING THE Script_Section
#: WITH THE VERIFIED Opcode_Map AND TRACING THE API CALLING CONVENTION, and is
#: identified by opcode, call-site offset and API slot rather than by byte-value
#: coincidence.
#:
#: WHY IT IS NOT ``CANDIDATE_B``. Requirement 1.4 defines Candidate B as a
#: byte-value FIELD SCAN over the blob, and task 1.3 states in as many words "do
#: NOT decode opcodes". That method FAILED under controls: a no-companion control
#: enemy (0x54) produced the same hit rate, the u8 counts fell BELOW uniform
#: chance because 80 of 256 byte values are CASTLE type ids, and the only
#: survivor of cross-checking was ``blob+0x10`` u32 = the entry's OWN type id
#: (80/80 across CASTLE) -- a self id, not a spawn edge. Returning
#: ``CANDIDATE_B`` for a bytecode-recovered edge would credit a method that did
#: not work, and would make the notes unreadable to anyone auditing which
#: technique actually paid off.

    ALL THREE ARGUMENTS MUST BE NOISE-FILTERED, EDGE-BEARING EVIDENCE -- NOT the
    raw probe output. Specifically:

    ``a_named_candidates``
        NOT the raw CASTLE-only set. The design is explicit: "Candidate A is
        CONFIRMED only if a CASTLE-only type id is also NAMED from 0x49's or
        0x53's data" -- the raw difference is a pool, and a pool is not an edge.
        So pass only those CASTLE-only ids that some measurement actually tied to
        a root enemy. Passing the raw 27-id (or narrowed 10-id) pool here yields
        a FALSE ``CANDIDATE_A``.
    ``b_edge_hits``
        ``FieldHit``s from ``scan_blob_for_type_ids`` that SURVIVED control
        comparison and name a DIFFERENT entity. Pass an empty sequence when the
        surviving hits are self ids (like ``blob+0x10``) or when a
        no-companion control enemy produces the same hit rate. Passing the raw
        scan output here yields a FALSE ``CANDIDATE_B``.
    ``c_edge_coreferences``
        ``CoReference``s that survived the same treatment: root byte in a field
        the ``.PSX`` format actually defines as holding a type id, and a hit
        rate above the base rate and above the control roots. Passing the raw
        list here yields a FALSE ``CANDIDATE_C``.
    ``d_bytecode_edges``
        Spawn edges recovered by DECODING the Script_Section -- in practice the
        ``literal_edges`` of the ``SpawnEdgeReport``s below. This evidence needs
        no control comparison, and that is the whole point of it: an edge
        identified by opcode, call-site offset and API slot cannot be a byte
        coincidence, which is precisely what sank Candidate B and Candidate C.
        Defaulted to empty so every pre-existing three-argument caller keeps its
        meaning exactly.

    Precedence: D FIRST -- a decoded call site is the strongest evidence
    available, strictly stronger than any of the three byte-pattern methods, so
    it wins over B, C and A. Then B, because a surviving blob field naming a
    companion would also be the edge. Then C, an edge recorded outside the blob.
    A last, because A only narrows the pool. ``UNRESOLVED`` if and only if ALL
    FOUR are empty (Requirement 1.8 as widened).

    Pure: no I/O, no mutation, no globals.

MEASURED_VERDICT: str = "CANDIDATE_D_BYTECODE"


# ============================================================================
# CANDIDATE D (the fourth method) -- READ THE EDGE OUT OF THE BYTECODE.
#
# Candidates A, B and C all failed, and the notes above say why: A can only
# produce a pool, B was explicitly forbidden from decoding opcodes ("do NOT
# decode opcodes", because no decoder existed), and C's own criterion came back
# negative under controls.
#
# `randomizer/befscript.py` now exists and is fully verified: 158 opcodes all at
# `verified` confidence, measured from the engine's own handlers, and every one
# of the game's 530 script sections decodes at 100% coverage and round-trips
# byte-exactly. So the edge is directly readable: `49 CScriptApi::Spawn`
# (arity 1) takes a BEF type id, and the compiler these scripts came out of
# passes it as a literal push.
#
# THE CALLING CONVENTION (measured; it corrected a wrong first attempt).
# Arguments are NOT passed by the `*_apiparam` opcodes (0x8D-0x90). This
# compiler pushes onto the operand stack and drains into the API argument block:
#
#     by_c_push value=0x8C      <- the spawn type id, as a literal
#     popapiparam               <- or by_popsetapiparam count=N
#     by_callapi api_index=0x31 <- CScriptApi::Spawn, slot 49, arity 1
#
# `popapiparam` (0x15) moves one value; `popsetapiparam` / `by_popsetapiparam`
# (0x16/0x17) move `count`. A tracer that looks for `*_apiparam` finds zero
# arguments on every call -- that is the tracer being wrong, not the script
# being empty. So recovering a `Spawn` argument means running a small stack
# machine over the `*_push` family.
#
# WHAT THIS ORACLE WILL AND WILL NOT CLAIM.
#   * A LITERAL spawn argument (`c_push` / `by_c_push`) is recoverable and is
#     reported as an edge.
#   * A NON-LITERAL argument -- `by_m_push member=N`, a local, a register -- is
#     NOT recoverable statically and is reported as such, never guessed. This
#     case is real: Bomb_Skeleton's fuse comes from member field 12, so the

    and ``0xBA`` spawning EACH OTHER inside Snowman ``0x1D``'s group, so the old

    VISIT-ONCE DEDUPE -- the same rule Requirement 3.5 already demanded for the
    acyclic diamond -- and only expansion beyond ``max_depth`` refuses.

    THE ORDER OF THE TWO CHECKS IS LOAD-BEARING. ``target in seen`` is tested
    BEFORE the depth test, so a SECOND, DEEPER path to an already-recorded member

    ``0x49 -> 0x5E`` at depth 1, ``0x5E -> 0x44``/``0xEB`` at depth 2, while
    ``0x44``/``0xEB`` are ALSO direct depth-1 edges of ``0x49``. Testing depth
    first would refuse it at ``max_depth = 2`` if the limit were ever tightened,
    and would refuse it today for any deeper diamond. Because the walk is
    breadth-first (``queue.pop(0)``), every member is recorded at its SHALLOWEST
    depth.

    Raises ``CompanionResolveError`` when a NEW entity sits deeper than

#     kill group and no ``PROTECTED_TAGS`` entry can be touched -- that safety is
#     STRUCTURAL here, not a check that could be forgotten.
#   * ANYTHING WE CANNOT PROVE PARSES IS A REFUSAL. Every blob this module stages
#     is re-parsed through the same material walk the porter used, and a blob
#     that will not walk refuses the ROOT.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, AND THE HONEST LIMIT OF WHAT IS KNOWN. If
    ``allocate_type_id`` ever hands a companion an id DIFFERENT from its source
    id, the blob's +0x10 field still says the OLD id, and the entry is then
    internally inconsistent: the TOC says one thing, the blob says another.
    WHETHER THE ENGINE READS THIS FIELD IS NOT ESTABLISHED. What was read in the
    ELF is that ``LoadBoundEntityFile`` obtains the id from
    ``CVmBefReader::ReadEntityID(i)`` -- an index-driven read that the disassembly
    shows going through the reader, not through the blob body -- and passes it to
    ``CVmEntityManager::Load(parser, id)``, which is what ``CHashTable::Add``
    keys on. That is consistent with +0x10 being unread, but it does not prove
    ``ReadEntityInfo`` ignores it, and `LoadBoundEntityFile` aborts the WHOLE
    file if any `Load` fails.
    SO THE FIELD IS UPDATED ANYWAY. Making the blob agree with its TOC entry is
    correct under either reading and costs four bytes of write; leaving a stale
    id is only safe under the reading we cannot yet prove. In practice the field
    is rarely touched at all, because ``allocate_type_id`` prefers the source id
