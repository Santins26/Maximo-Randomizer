"""Boss injection into ordinary levels (GraveDigger `0x29` into grave).

PORTS HIS ASSETS. The old premise -- "every asset the boss references is a
Resident_Asset of `GRAVE.PRS`" -- is REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT: `GRAVE_B.PRS`
(2,782,263 B, 24 meshes, 49 anims) and `GRAVE_B.PRT` (550,512 B, 37 entries, 34
CLUTs) DO exist and ARE the boss's source archive. Blob `0x29`'s single LOCAL
category-1 reference is mesh 0, and in `GRAVE.PRS` index 0 resolves to a 0-bone
`tombdown` prop -- which is exactly why the injected boss was invisible and
froze the level. `prove_residency` is therefore GONE, replaced by a real port:

  * `GRAVE_B.PRS` mesh[0] (306,920 B, tag 6, 57 bones, 50 render passes),
  * `GRAVE_B.PRS` anim records 0..21 (569,861 B, every one tag 0x0C SKA),
  * `GRAVE_B.PRT` textures 0, 1, 2 (142,384 B), the only ones mesh[0]'s render
    passes reach,

= 1,019,165 B into `GRAVE.PRS`/`GRAVE.PRT`, with blob `0x29`'s references
rewritten to the new indices. The rest of the work is unchanged: derive and
merge a set of BEF types, place one `.PSX` record in a recycled slot, and merge
13 sound ids.

SECOND MEASURED BUG, NOW FIXED -- THE CLOSURE WAS PORTED FOR NOBODY BUT THE
BOSS. Porting only `0x29`'s assets and rewriting only `0x29`'s references left
the other TEN Merge_Set members injected VERBATIM with their `GRAVE_B`-LOCAL
references intact: 21 unrewritten LOCAL slots (12 category-1, 9 category-2)
naming 11 distinct source meshes and 10 distinct source anims. Every one of them
is IN RANGE of the live counts, so the pre-existing bounds check was blind to
it, and resolved against `GRAVE.PRS` they land on structurally incompatible
assets (`guswall`, 2,060 B / 0 bones, resolving onto a 61,160 B 31-bone
skeleton; `slameff` 5,256 B onto 142,532 B / 39 bones; `gus_soul_id10` 644 B onto
131,484 B / 36 bones; 7 of the 10 anim references crossing record class, source
MEA `0x0A` against target SKA `0x0C`). The companions are Spawn-on-activation
impact effects, which is why the symptom was a crash after walking the map.

The port is therefore DERIVED, not constant-driven, and covers EVERY injected
member: `derive_merge_set` runs FIRST, the union of every injected member's LOCAL
category-1/category-2 references is deduped and ported ONCE per distinct asset,
every ported mesh's render passes are remapped, and EVERY injected member's blob
is rewritten -- not just `0x29`'s. A new IDENTITY check (`Identity_Check`, not a
bounds check) requires every LOCAL reference of every injected member to read a
map VALUE, so a source index that merely happens to be in range now FAILS.

Project convention, deliberate and load-bearing here: NO public function in this
module raises on malformed data. A failure is a VERDICT carrying `ok`, `reasons`
and `details`, in the shape `cross_world.WorldPortSession.refuse(plan, reason,
details)` already consumes.

The refusal model is absolute rather than cautious because
`CVmEntityManager::LoadBoundEntityFile` ABORTS THE LOAD OF THE WHOLE `.BEF` if
any single entry fails to parse: a partially valid merge does not give a
slightly-wrong boss, it gives a level that will not load.

THE SCRIPT EDITS THIS MODULE MAKES, AND NOTHING ELSE. Injection works in game,
and killing the GraveDigger teleported the player into the GraveDigger boss
fight -- the `Early_Exit_Risk` firing. The user has REVERSED the earlier
"gotonextlevel doesnt need to be implemented" scoping and asked for the call to
go. That fill WORKED: no more teleport. It also let state 20 run to completion
for the first time, and the NEW in-game symptom is that Maximo is frozen in
place after the boss dies. `patch_boss_script` therefore applies up to TWO
measured, length-preserving, in-place 5-byte spans in the boss Script_Section:

  * span A, `0x13CA` -- the `GotoNextLevel` call site, replaced by
    `CutScene_Stop()` (api 185, arity 0) plus three nops, so the exit is still
    gone AND any running cutscene is stopped;
  * span B, `0x1125` -- the ONLY `CameraSetBossFlag(32)` call site, replaced by
    five nops, so the never-cleared boss camera flag is never set.

Both spans are the same three-instruction push/popapiparam/callapi idiom, both
are verified byte-exact before being rewritten and REFUSED on any mismatch, and
no instruction offset anywhere moves. Nothing else in any Script_Section is ever
touched. See the BOSS SCRIPT SPANS comment block below for the measurement. The
level-exit removal is confirmed in game; the other two edits are SUSPICION-
driven and nobody has watched them unfreeze anything.

Nothing in this module claims the boss renders, animates, moves or makes a
sound. Nobody has watched it. `CANDIDATE` is the status ceiling.

# --- THE BOSS SCRIPT SPANS -------------------------------------------------
# Up to TWO measured, length-preserving, in-place 5-byte edits to the boss
# Script_Section, and nothing else in the section is ever touched. Both spans
# are the SAME three-instruction idiom -- `by_c_push` (0x04, len 2),
# `popapiparam` (0x15, len 1), `by_callapi` (0x8C, len 2) -- so both are exactly
# 5 bytes wide and both can be re-tiled by length-1 instructions without moving
# a single offset.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Boss injection works in game and killing the GraveDigger
# teleported the player into the GraveDigger boss fight -- the Early_Exit_Risk
# firing. The user, having earlier scoped `GotoNextLevel` OUT ("gotonextlevel
# doesnt need to be implemented"), has REVERSED that call and asked for the
# call to be removed. Both the earlier scoping and this reversal are the user's,
# recorded so the decision stays attributable.
#
# WHAT IS PATCHED. Blob `0x29` of `GRAVE_B.BEF`: 8,688 B, material section
# [0xD0,0x43A), Script_Section [0x536,0x21CF) of length 0x1C99 = 7,321 B,
# 2,996 instructions, clean decode, coverage 1.0, byte-exact `encode()` round
# trip. The call site is THREE CONTIGUOUS instructions, 5 bytes, at
# Script_Section offset 0x13CA (blob-absolute 0x1900 = 0x536 + 0x13CA), raw
# `04 00 15 8C 71`:
#
#     0x13CA  04 00   by_c_push  value=0        the literal argument
#     0x13CC  15      popapiparam               moves it into the API arg block
#     0x13CD  8C 71   by_callapi api_index=0x71 = 113 GotoNextLevel
#
# The call is the NARROW form `0x8C` (one-byte api index), not the wide `0x8B`.
#
# WHY FIVE BYTES, EXACTLY. Five is the smallest push/consume-BALANCED unit.
# Nopping only the 2-byte call leaves a stray 0 sitting in the API argument
# block; nopping 3 bytes (push + popapiparam) strands the pushed value on the
# VM stack. Taking all three instructions leaves both the stack and the arg
# block exactly as the surrounding code expects.
#
# WHY 0xFE. Opcode 0xFE is mnemonic `nop`, length 1, ZERO operands, handler
# 0x0010B230, confidence `verified`, present in BOTH the retail and prototype
# opcode maps and NOT in `befscript.INVALID_OPCODES` (0xE8..0xFD). Five
# length-1 arity-0 instructions tile the 5-byte span exactly, so the decode
# stays in phase and the section length is unchanged.
#
# WHY IT IS SAFE, all measured on the real bytes:
#   * exactly ONE branch targets the span -- `0x13B1 by_r_ifeqz` -> `0x13CA`,
#     i.e. the FIRST byte of the fill, so it lands on a nop and falls through;
#     nothing at all targets 0x13CB, 0x13CC, 0x13CD or 0x13CE;
#   * the four offset-directory tables start at 0x442 (0x43A holds the section
#     length 0x1C99, then a zero u32) with counts 22/22/8/4, and NO entry lies
#     inside or at either edge of 0x13CA..0x13CE -- the bracketing entries are
#     0x139D below and 0x13D6 above;
#   * `GotoNextLevel` is called EXACTLY ONCE out of 337 `callapi` sites, and
#     this blob has ZERO sites for every other transition API: EnterSubLevel
#     (94), TransportHubLevel (74), GetNextHubCount (73),
#     CheckSubLevelCompleted (66), PlayerSetStartPosition (62), ChangeMaximo
#     (61);
#   * after the fill control reaches `0x13CF by_c_push 0x14` -> `popapiparam`
#     -> `by_callapi SetState(20)` -> `exit`, so the death sequence still
#     completes.
#
# THE LEVEL-EXIT FILL IS CONFIRMED IN GAME: killing the injected GraveDigger no
# longer teleports the player.
#
# THE NEW SYMPTOM, AND WHY THESE TWO FURTHER EDITS EXIST. Maximo is now FROZEN
# IN PLACE after the boss dies and cannot move. The nop fill did NOT remove a
# teardown: it let state 20 run to COMPLETION for the first time, because
# `GotoNextLevel` previously fired two instructions before `SetState(20)`. A
# set/clear audit of ALL 337 callapi sites in this blob found exactly two
# SET-WITHOUT-CLEAR calls, and they are the suspects:
#
#   * `CameraSetBossFlag(32)` -- api 232 = 0xE8 -- at Script_Section 0x1128,
#     the ONLY site. Its inverse `CameraClearBossFlag` (233 = 0xE9) exists in
#     the API table and is called NOWHERE in the blob.
#   * `CutScene_Start(1000)` -- api 184 = 0xB8 -- at 0x0131. Its inverse
#     `CutScene_Stop` (185 = 0xB9, ARITY 0) exists and is called NOWHERE.
#
# WHY THE `CameraClearBossFlag(32)` SUBSTITUTION AT 0x13CA WAS REJECTED. It is
# provably ineffective, not merely unproven: state 20's ENTER handler at 0x1105
# CONTAINS the 0x1128 set, and `SetState(20)` is executed at 0x13D2 -- two
# instructions AFTER 0x13CA. Clearing the flag and then entering the state that
# sets it leaves the flag set. It is not implemented and must not be.
#
# SPAN B -- 0x1125, 5 bytes, `04 20 15 8C E8`:
#
#     0x1125  04 20   by_c_push  value=0x20 = 32   the flag mask
#     0x1127  15      popapiparam
#     0x1128  8C E8   by_callapi api_index=0xE8 = 232 CameraSetBossFlag
#
# replaced by FE FE FE FE FE. Removing the SET is the conservative move: nothing
# then needs clearing, and it takes a call away rather than introducing one the
# blob never made.
#
# SPAN A -- 0x13CA, the same 5 bytes as before, filled with
# `8C B9 FE FE FE` instead of five nops:
#
#     0x13CA  8C B9   by_callapi api_index=0xB9 = 185 CutScene_Stop
#     0x13CC  FE      nop
#     0x13CD  FE      nop
#     0x13CE  FE      nop
#
# The single inbound branch (`0x13B1 by_r_ifeqz` -> `0x13CA`) still lands on the
# FIRST byte of the span, which is now the first byte of the `by_callapi`, so it
# is still instruction-aligned; it calls `CutScene_Stop()` and falls through into
# `0x13CF by_c_push 0x14` -> `popapiparam` -> `SetState(20)` -> `exit` exactly as
# before. Nothing targets 0x13CB..0x13CE, so re-tiling inside the span is safe.
#
# `CutScene_Stop` is ARITY 0, so it needs no `by_c_push` and no `popapiparam`
# and fits inside the span already owned with three bytes to spare. The ORIGINAL
# bytes at the span are still `04 00 15 8C 71` and the existing guard still
# verifies them. `GotoNextLevel` is still gone; `CutScene_Stop()` now runs.
#
# BOTH NEW EDITS ARE ON SUSPICION. The evidence is the set/clear audit plus the
# API names, and nothing more. It is NOT established that boss camera flag 32 or
# the cutscene state gates player movement AT ALL, and neither edit has been
# observed to unfreeze the player. STRUCTURAL ONLY.

#: Neutralize the boss script's level-exit call. ON by default at the user's
#: explicit request after observing the teleport in game, and CONFIRMED in game
#: to stop the teleport. A kill switch, not a knob: False restores the verbatim
#: script exactly, including the full byte-identity static check.
NEUTRALIZE_LEVEL_EXIT: bool = True

#: Fill for the level-exit span. `CutScene_Stop` (api 185, arity 0) needs no
#: push, so it fits in the span already owned with three nops to spare. OFF
#: leaves the span as five nops, i.e. exactly today's behaviour. This switch
#: only has an effect while `NEUTRALIZE_LEVEL_EXIT` is True, because the call
#: is written into the span that neutralization owns -- no new bytes are ever
#: claimed for it.
STOP_CUTSCENE_ON_DEATH: bool = False

#: Offset of the three-instruction call site WITHIN the Script_Section (NOT
#: blob-absolute; blob-absolute is 0x536 + this = 0x1900).
LEVEL_EXIT_SCRIPT_OFFSET = 0x13CA

#: The exact 5 bytes that must be there. A different disc revision, a different
#: build, anything at all other than this, and the patch REFUSES. Bytes we did
#: not measure are never rewritten.
LEVEL_EXIT_ORIGINAL_BYTES = bytes((0x04, 0x00, 0x15, 0x8C, 0x71))

#: 0xFE `nop`: length 1, arity 0, verified in both revisions, and NOT in
#: `befscript.INVALID_OPCODES`.
LEVEL_EXIT_NOP_FILL      = bytes((0xFE,)) * 5              # exit removed only
LEVEL_EXIT_CUTSCENE_FILL = bytes((0x8C, 0xB9, 0xFE, 0xFE, 0xFE))  # + CutScene_Stop

#: --- THE REDIRECT (option four) ------------------------------------------
#: Neither freeze edit worked, and the ELF says why. `CameraSetBossFlag` is a
#: thin wrapper into `Camera::SetBossFlag` and cannot gate input;
#: `CutScene_Stop` only sets a deferred request word; all 106
#: `Player::SetAction` call sites live inside `Player` itself, so nothing
#: outside the player ever sets its action; and `mglGotoNextLevel` touches no
#: player state at all. What it DOES do is
#:     sw 6, gp-29056   (app mode)
#:     sw 3, gp-29092   (app SUBMODE = advance)
#:     swc1 f0, gp-29088  (transition time, arg scaled against 1000.0)
#: while `mglRestartLevel` writes 6 to that SAME submode word and nothing else.
#: So input is not being held by a lock the boss sets -- it is held because the
#: App never completes a transition, and in vanilla the level change is what
#: restores control.
#:
#: Therefore: do NOT remove the transition. REDIRECT it. `EnterSubLevel`
#: (api 94 = 0x5E, arity 1) is the SAME three-instruction
#: push/popapiparam/callapi idiom as the call being replaced, so the span stays
#: five bytes and no offset moves. The App still runs its mode-6 handoff and
#: restores input exactly the way vanilla does; it just lands in a sublevel of
#: the current world instead of the GraveDigger arena.
#:
#: Rejected: patching the submode constant at 0x129318 from 3 to 6, which would
#: turn EVERY level exit in the game into a restart and break progression
#: outright; and repointing a spare CScriptApi slot at `mglRestartLevel`, which
#: needs a dispatch table this module has NOT confirmed (the candidate found in
#: the ELF disagrees with the recovered spec at slots 0, 1 and 232, so it is
#: not the table).
REDIRECT_LEVEL_EXIT: bool = False

#: The sublevel operand. This is the ONE value not pinned by measurement:
#: `giNextSubLevel` is engine state and the grave hub's own index was never
#: read out. It is a single byte and it is safe to iterate on -- a wrong value
#: lands in a different sublevel, it does not corrupt anything.
BOSS_EXIT_SUBLEVEL: int = 0

#: api 94, arity 1, tail call `mglEnterSubLevel`.
ENTER_SUBLEVEL_API_INDEX = 0x5E

#: --- SPAN C: DO NOT RUN THE DEATH SEQUENCE AT ALL ------------------------
#: The chosen fix. Every attempt to release the freeze AFTER the death
#: sequence failed, and every candidate lock has been eliminated by
#: disassembly. So the death sequence never runs.
#:
#: The boss post-death chain is STRICTLY LINEAR and each state has EXACTLY ONE
#: entry site in the whole 2,996-instruction section:
#:     SetState(17) @0x170D  <- the only way in
#:     SetState(18) @0x10FF  (from state 17 UPDATE)
#:     SetState(21) @0x1363  (from state 18 UPDATE)
#:     SetState(20) @0x13D2  (from state 21 UPDATE)
#: `GotoNextLevel` @0x13CD lives inside that chain, as does
#: `CameraSetBossFlag(32)` @0x1128 and the 120-frame countdown. Replacing the
#: single entry at 0x170D makes the ENTIRE chain unreachable: no teleport, no
#: countdown, no camera flag, and nothing in it that could hold the player.
#:
#: `Kill` (api 28 = 0x1C, arity 1) is the same three-instruction
#: push/popapiparam/callapi idiom, so the span stays five bytes and no offset
#: moves. The boss dies and is removed instead of playing a death sequence.
#: COST: no death animation or effects -- he vanishes. That is the deliberate
#: trade for being able to walk afterwards.
#:
#: Because the chain is unreachable, span A is RETIRED and the level-exit bytes
#: ship VERBATIM: NEUTRALIZE_LEVEL_EXIT and REDIRECT_LEVEL_EXIT are both False.
KILL_INSTEAD_OF_DEATH_SEQUENCE: bool = False

#: Script_Section offset of the ONLY SetState(17) site (blob-absolute 0x1C40).
DEATH_ENTRY_SCRIPT_OFFSET = 0x170A

#: `by_c_push 17, popapiparam, by_callapi 0x2E (46 SetState)`. Verified, and the

#: skip only the camera updates and still fall into it. So input is always
#: READ; the freeze is the player's move state ignoring it, not a suppressed
#: input path.
#:
#: The mechanism was NOT identified. Nine candidates were eliminated against
#: the ELF (see design.md). Rather than assert a tenth, this span does the one
#: thing that directly names the symptom: it calls `ResetFreeze` on the player.
#:
#: `ResetFreeze` is api 3, arity 1, tail call GetEngineObjectLink. `-2` is the
#: player/target selector, established by THIS blob's own
#: `EnableCollisions(-2, 0, 0)` and `(-2, 5, 1)` calls at 0x0041, 0x0072,
#: 0x10AD, 0x10BA and 0x1703.
#:
#: TEN bytes are claimed, not five, because `c_push` of a negative literal is
#: 5 bytes on its own. The span covers the level-exit call AND the
#: `SetState(20)` that follows it. Losing `SetState(20)` is harmless: state 20
#: is the inert terminal state, both of whose handlers (T0[20]=0x138F,
#: T1[20]=0x1391) are a bare `exit`. The boss simply remains in state 21.
#:
#: WHY THIS SPAN IS REGRESSION-SAFE, unlike the state-17 attempt: 0x13CA is
#: PROVEN to execute only after death -- nopping it is what removed the
#: teleport in game. It cannot run during normal combat.
#:
#: HONEST STATUS: a grounded attempt, NOT a diagnosis. If `-2` is not the
#: player here, or freezing is not what holds him, this is a no-op and the
#: player stays stuck. It cannot make anything worse.

    22 records are SKA (tag 0x0C) and carry no such magic, so the signature
    lands on record 22 and the anchor reports a table of 13 records starting
    2,378,397 bytes in -- 569,861 bytes PAST the real table, and with every
    index shifted by 36. Measured: the real table starts at the mesh walk's end

def port_boss_assets(game_files_dir, member_blobs, *, log=None) -> PortVerdict:
    """Port the DERIVED asset closure of EVERY INJECTED Merge_Set member.

    `member_blobs` is `{type_id: blob}` for every member that will actually be
    INJECTED -- i.e. the Merge_Set minus the types `GRAVE.BEF` already declares
    -- with `BOSS_TYPE` among them. That is why `derive_merge_set` now runs
    BEFORE this call: the port cannot know what to carry until it knows who is
    travelling. Porting `0x29`'s assets alone, which is what this function used
    to do, left the other ten members' LOCAL references pointing at whatever
    `GRAVE.PRS` happens to hold at the same index -- 21 slots, all in range, all
    wrong (see the module docstring).

    NOTHING here is constant-driven. For every injected member the LOCAL
    category-1 and category-2 references are parsed out of its own blob, the
    union is DEDUPED, each distinct mesh entry and anim record travels ONCE, the
    reachable texture set is derived from the ported meshes' own render passes,
    and EVERY member's blob is rewritten through the resulting maps.
    `BOSS_SOURCE_MESH_INDEX` / `BOSS_SOURCE_ANIM_INDICES` survive only as a
    SANITY check that the derivation still sees the boss where it was measured.

    Order, and one `.PRS` in memory at a time (at most four binaries in flight):

      1. `GRAVE_B.PRS`: gate the walk; for EVERY mesh in the union slice the
         entry, take its signature, its bone AND mesh-node names and its render
         passes; slice EVERY anim record in the union through `derive_anim_table`;
         run the per-member, per-mesh binding check. The buffer is dropped
         before the target is opened, so every byte needed later is sliced in
         this single pass.
      2. `GRAVE.PRS`: gate the walk, append each mesh entry
         (`mesh_port.insert_mesh_entry`) and every record in one
         `anim_port.append_anim_records` call.
      3. `GRAVE_B.PRT` -> `GRAVE.PRT`: port each distinct reachable texture ONCE
         with `texture_port.extract_texture` / `inject_texture`.
      4. Rewrite EVERY appended mesh copy's render-pass texture ids through the
         remap with `prs_mesh_parser.patch_texture_ids`; `-1` passes untouched.
      5. Rewrite EVERY injected member's LOCAL references with
         `bef.set_material_ref_index`, leaving category-0 refs alone, then
         re-parse and prove each one ref for ref -- and additionally prove
         IDENTITY: every rewritten index must equal a MAP VALUE, never a source
         index that merely happens to be in range.

    Every low-level call is the one `cross_world._port_enemy` uses, in the same
    order, under the same discipline.

    BINDING IS CHECKED PER MEMBER, PER MESH -- NEVER UNIONED. `RecurseAttachAnim`
    walks ONE `PMeshNode` tree, so a record must bind to a SINGLE mesh of the
    member that references it. `mesh_entry_anim_target_names` returns a PAIR and
    unpacking it is load-bearing: SKA (`0x0C`) records address BONES, MEA
    (`0x0A`) records address MESH NODES. Every companion record measured is MEA,
    so nodes are what matter for them; iterating the pair itself would hand the
    gate a two-element list of TUPLES that no name can ever match (the
    `companion_port` precedent).

    NAME TOLERANCE, SCOPED EXACTLY AS BEFORE. A record whose names do not
    resolve ships UNCHANGED only when (a) the rig is a mesh ported here
    byte-for-byte as `GRAVE_B` ships it and (b) the same names are missing from
    THAT SAME MESH IN THE SOURCE ARCHIVE, so the engine's lookup fails
    identically in vanilla -- porting renames nothing and changes only index
    NUMBERS. Every such case is recorded in `tolerated_anims` with the member,
    the record index, the mesh it was checked against and the missing names.
    `can_bind_to_rig` is NOT relaxed, `MEA_UNMATCHED_NODE_IS_SKIPPED` is NOT
    extended, and no name is substituted. A record whose binding is
    UNDETERMINED or BY_INDEX still REFUSES, and dropping a record is never an
    option: the blob carries references TO it, so omitting it would leave a
    DANGLING REFERENCE.
