"""
Editable spawn-rate configuration for the Maximo: Ghosts to Glory randomizer.

This module turns the randomizer's hard-coded weight tables into a user-editable
config, organized by TAG (enemies / items / structures) and, for enemies, split
WORLD-by-WORLD. Each entry carries a weight (0-100) and an enabled flag; a
disabled entry (or weight 0) is removed from every spawn pool so it never
appears in the randomized game.

The config is JSON-serializable so the GUI can save/load it, and exposes helper
methods that produce the exact weight dicts the randomizer pipeline consumes:

  - universal_weights(world): weights for randomize_universal()'s item pool
        (items + structures + the enemies available in that world).
  - enemy_weights_for_world(world): per-enemy weights for the cli.py even-out
        balancing bag.
  - disabled_enemies(world): enemy type-ids to drop from a world's pool.

Defaults are derived from items.DEFAULT_ITEM_WEIGHTS, scaled so the largest
entry maps to 100. Because the randomizer only cares about RELATIVE weights,
the default config reproduces the stock spawn behavior exactly.

    THE BUGFIX. The switch itself now means "yes". Before this, the candidate
    set came only from `SpawnConfig.enabled_structure_arrival_keys`, and because
    every stock route ships `enabled=False` (and a pre-version-3 file carries no
    `structure_arrivals` section at all), that set was ALWAYS empty -- so ticking
    the switch could never port a structure. Two cases are now distinguished:

    * EXPLICIT -- the user actually made a selection (see
      `SpawnConfig.has_explicit_structure_selection`). Their subset is honoured
      EXACTLY, including the empty one: explicitly ticking nothing still ports
      nothing.
    * FALLBACK -- no explicit selection was ever saved (the stock config, an old
      config file, or `config is None` because no config was supplied at all).
      Every SELECTABLE route for the world becomes a candidate and the existing
      resource budget decides how many actually fit.

    THIS ONLY ANSWERS "WHICH ROUTES DID THE USER WANT", NEVER "WHICH ROUTES ARE
    ALLOWED". The fallback set is `selectable_structure_arrival_keys(world)` --
    the permission oracle itself -- so it can never contain a withheld, refused,
    unmeasured, inactive or held-back route, and the returned set is a subset of
    that oracle in BOTH cases (the explicit case is re-validated against it by
    `enabled_structure_arrival_keys`). Nothing here is promoted: every route

#:   * `DEFAULT_ITEM_WEIGHTS` totals 1,360, of which 282 is enemies and 1,078 is
#:     the ITEM half (items + structures). `randomize_universal` renormalizes the
#:     enemy block to `ENEMY_SHARE_TARGET` (0.20) whatever else changes, so a
#:     structure weight competes only inside that 1,078 and can NEVER take share
#:     from enemies.
#:   * a native smashable in that table is 3-10 (Globe 3, Ice Plant 5, most 8,
#:     Coin Container 10). At 5 that is 5/1078 = 0.46% of the item half, 0.37% of
#:     all retyped slots — which is why a ported structure was reported as
#:     appearing "too little": it was competing at one four-hundredth of a share.
#:   * 25 is not a round guess: it is the weight this repo ALREADY chose for the
#:     same problem. `0x24` Collector and `0x02` Bonus_Grave sit at 25 with the
#:     comment "bumped, was effectively invisible" — a fun-but-minor spawn is
#:     visible at 25 and invisible below it. It is also still well under
#:     Gem (42), Locked_Chest (52), Bag_Of_Gold (62), Wooden_Chest (170) and
#:     GoldCoin (471).
#:
#: WHAT IT BUYS. Per ARRIVING type: 25/(~1030 + 25N) of the item half, so with a
#: single arrival ~1.9% of the item half and ~1.5% of ALL retyped slots — four
#: times the old 0.37%. With the out-of-the-box fallback (every selectable route
#: a candidate, typically ~11 types reaching one world) the arrivals together
#: take 25*11/(1030+275) = ~21% of the item half, ~17% of all retyped slots.
#:
#: THE TRADEOFF, stated. Raising this trades ITEM frequency for structure
#: variety and nothing else: enemies are renormalized independently, and items
#: keep ~79% of their own half at the 11-route worst case (GoldCoin alone stays
#: the single most likely roll at ~36% of that half). Going to 50 would put the
#: same worst case at ~35% of the item half, which starts to read as a takeover
#: rather than as variety, so this is deliberately parked at the "visible"

                            than load bearing, but it is still the behaviour for
                            a config whose rows were all unticked without the
                            selection being marked explicit — which is precisely
                            what `apply_harder_mode_preset` relies on marking.
                            See `SpawnConfig.structure_route_weights`, which
                            routes through `structure_routes_for_world` rather
                            than re-deriving the candidate set from `enabled`.

    Only SELECTABLE routes get an entry, so -- exactly as in the legacy tables --
    a hand-edited file has no key to switch a held-back, inactive or unmeasured
    route on, and `from_dict` never creates one.

# Three legacy tables become ONE. The mapping, verbatim from the design:
#
#     universal_weights[world][type]   -> native:<type>
#     arrivals[world][route]           -> enemy:<route>
#     structure_arrivals[world][route] -> structure:<route>
#
# A v3 FILE has no `universal_weights` key -- that projection is COMPUTED from
# the three sections a v3 file actually carries (`items`, `structures` and the
# per-world `enemies`), so those are the sections read here, and each maps to a
# `native:` id.
#
# ALL-OR-NOTHING (Req 8.3). Either a complete v4 config comes out or
# `MigrationError` (U9) is raised naming the field that could not be mapped.
# There is no half-loaded state and no path on which a user's arrival selections
# silently revert.
#
# THE ONE ASYMMETRY (Req 8.4). `enabled` is copied VERBATIM: a route the user
# turned OFF in v3 is off in v4 and NOTHING here turns it back on. A key the
# user never saw takes the v4 default instead.
#
# U9 vs U10, drawn precisely:
#   * U9  (FATAL) -- the field EXISTS and is structurally unmappable: a section
#                    that is not an object, an entry that is not an object, a
#                    weight that is not a number or is negative, or a key that
#                    does not parse as a type id / route at all. Nothing can be
#                    said about what the user meant, so we refuse rather than
#                    drop it silently.
#   * U10 (not fatal) -- the field parses FINE but names no known v4 Candidate
#                    (a route since deactivated, an unmeasured route, a world
#                    that no longer exists). Reported as DROPPED and NOT
#                    resurrected, exactly as `from_dict`'s overlays already
#                    treat an unknown key.
#
# THIS MODULE PRINTS NOTHING -- it has no `print` and no logger, by convention
# (its only I/O is `save`/`load`). The report is returned as DATA for the caller
# to log (task 4's job).
#
# READ, NOT REWRITTEN IN PLACE (Req 8.2). Migration is a pure dict -> dict
# transform: the input dict is never mutated and the v3 FILE is never touched.
# Only `save()` writes, and it writes v4.

#: WHICH DIRECTION THE WEIGHT SCALE IS CONVERTED, AND WHY.
#:
#: v3 stores every weight on the CONFIG's own 0-100 scale: the item/structure
#: sections are `DEFAULT_ITEM_WEIGHTS` values multiplied by `_default_scale()`
#: (= 100/471, so GoldCoin's 471 is stored as 100.0), and the enemy sections are
#: `WALKING_MELEE_WEIGHTS` multiplied by `ENEMY_DEFAULT_BASE` (= 100, so a
#: full-share enemy is stored as 100.0).
#:
#: Task 1 put the unified table on `DEFAULT_ITEM_WEIGHTS`' own 1,360 scale
#: (282 enemy / 1,078 item), so stock numbers migrate as THEMSELVES. Migration
#: therefore converts UPWARD, v3 -> v4, un-doing each legacy scaling:
#:
#:   item / structure / structure-route weight:  v4 = v3 / _default_scale()
#:                                                  = v3 * 471/100   (x4.71)
#:   enemy / enemy-route weight:                 v4 = v3 / 100 * 15   (x0.15)
#:
#: Checked against the stock numbers in both directions: a stock GoldCoin goes
#: 100.0 -> 471.0 (its `DEFAULT_ITEM_WEIGHTS` entry), a stock full-share enemy
#: goes 100.0 -> 15.0 (its entry), a stock reduced enemy at 0.5 share goes
#: 50.0 -> 7.5, and a stock structure route goes 5.3 -> ~25.0
#: (`STRUCTURE_ARRIVAL_DEFAULT_RAW_WEIGHT`). Getting either factor backwards
#: would change every spawn rate in the game and would be invisible in a diff,
#: which is why both are derived from the constants rather than written out as
#: numbers.
