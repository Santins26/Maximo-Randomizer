# CHALLENGE MODE: HOLY GROUND (checkpoint) SUPPRESSION
#
# Holy_Ground (type 0x07, class_name "Holy_Ground") is the mid-level
# checkpoint shrine: App::SetHolyGround stores it on touch and
# App::RestoreHolyGround puts Maximo back there on death/reload. 48 records
# exist across the 33 level files; hubs, boss arenas and skyboxes have none.
#
# When the Challenge Mode level timer is armed, a checkpoint anchor defeats
# the point of the clock (die, respawn mid-level, keep going), so every
# Holy_Ground is retyped into an inert entity.
#
# Why RETYPE and not delete: psx.py's writer works from an
# offset -> replacement map over the EXISTING record list. Removing a record
# would change the record count, which the writer does not support.
#
# Why the destination template must come from the SAME file: the engine
# resolves an entity's mesh through the world's BEF, and a type the BEF never
# loaded is a null-pointer lookup (a hard crash on level load). A template
# taken from a record that already exists in this very file is loadable by
# construction — no BEF table needs consulting and no type can be guessed
# wrong.

# FILE BEING PROCESSED — a candidate that isn't there is simply skipped, so
# whatever is chosen is BEF-loadable by construction.
#
# Two tiers, ordered by PREFERENCE only — there is no affordability test.
#
# Tier 1, the invisible ambience volumes, is PREFERRED because nothing visible
# appears where the shrine used to be. Each is a 0x2A8 record against
# Holy_Ground's 0x248, i.e. +0x60 bytes per record; that cost NO LONGER MATTERS
# because the records section is allowed to grow (see
# RECORDS_SECTION_SIZE_CEILING in psx.py) — that is the whole point of the
# change. Fog_Volume is first and therefore wins whenever the file has one.
#
# Tier 2, the same-size pickups, remains purely for TEMPLATE AVAILABILITY:
# some files (confirmed: C_SUB1.PSX) contain no invisible emitter of any kind,
# and the destination template MUST come from a record that already exists in
# THIS file so the engine can resolve its mesh through the world's BEF. A
# visible coin where a shrine used to be is strictly better than a checkpoint

            # 300,000 B below the shared budget -- so it refused to ship a build

        then had nothing to attach to. A seed that happened to draw one native
        (e.g. 0x2F Axe_Skeleton) produced the same bug in weaker form: only that
        one vanilla type was swappable, so foreign arrivals showed up a handful
        of times and never in maps lacking it.

    # `items.randomize_universal` builds its destination list as
    #     [t for t in pool if t in templates and weights.get(t, 0) > 0 ...]
    # so a type with no TEMPLATE RECORD is dropped BEFORE its weight is read.
    # `extra_templates` is `world_item_templates[world]`, harvested from that
    # world's OWN .PSX files -- and a cross-world arrival is by definition a type
    # the target world has no records of. Its weight was computed and discarded.
    #
    # Fix: generalise the `GLOBAL_TEMPLATE_TYPES` (Gold_Key) mechanism. For every
    # COMMITTED structure route, lend the TARGET world a template record of that
    # type harvested from the ROUTE'S SOURCE world.
    #
    # GATED STRICTLY ON THE COMMITTED SET. Only `committed_structures` routes are
    # walked -- never the allowlist, the config or the drawn order. Injecting a
    # template for a type whose mesh/art did NOT land in this world's
    # BEF/PRS/PRT would place a record the engine cannot render (invisible at
    # best, infinite load or crash at worst).
    #
    # NOT PERMISSION, NOT SIZE RELAXATION. A route still needs its allowlist row,
    # its measured cost row, and must have committed. Retyping stays
    # size-constrained (`SAME_SIZE_GROUPS` / `make_record_with_template`): an
    # injected template whose size class has no victim in the target world simply
    # never gets chosen, which is the correct harmless outcome. Victim-selection
    # filters (every Requirement 7 protection) are untouched -- this changes what
    # a slot may BECOME, never which slots are ELIGIBLE.
